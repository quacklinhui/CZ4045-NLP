there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.', 'Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out.', 'Alas, I was outnumbered.', 'Thank goodness!', 'I ordered the sea bass special.', 'It was to die for.', 'Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion.', 'I can not say enough good things about this dish.', 'When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said,

taste had red date in it.', 'Fancy!', 'A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something.', 'Basically all the desserts were more than $5.', \"That's crazy!\", 'I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50.', 'A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert.', 'Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side.', 'I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice.', 'My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!', \"I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work.\", 'We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled.', 'I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.', \"We've

      "SINGAPORE: When Jane* opened up to her secondary school counsellor about the cold wars and troubles she was having with some close friends, she was told that “life’s like that”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the then 14-year-old’s first session.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I felt ignored, like (school counselling is hopeless) even if I bring up my problems,” said Jane, now 17 and in her first year at junior college.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been “mandated” to attend counselling because she was frequently late for class and did not submit homework on time. She recalled her form teacher telling her outside the classroom, in full view and within earshot of her classmates, that a session had been arranged to address her tardiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It brings the idea that those who aren’t faring well have some problems and need to see the counsellor, rather than (the idea that) people … want to see a counsellor because of personal reasons,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After three compulsory sessions on her time management — none of which circled back to the issue with her friends — Jane did not hear from the counsellor again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the contrasting experience of Hanna Lee, 19, who was asked to see a counsellor when she was in Secondary 2 for frequent truancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t that I didn’t want to go to school. I just had trouble with getting there regularly,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her form teacher, who was aware of her family issues, texted or called her whenever she was absent to ask what was going on. One day, the teacher said: “If you need some help, I can arrange an appointment with the school counsellor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Lee was relieved. “I was finally getting help,” she thought. In the counselling room, where a diffuser emitted a calming scent and artwork adorned the walls, she sat on a couch with cushions all around, feeling safe as she vented (sometimes for up to three hours).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I definitely was a bit surprised,” she said, as she was not told about the ground rules for confidentiality. While she was not too affected, as the bullying incident was “kind of small”, a friend who confided her sexuality to the same counsellor had it worse.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the measures in place, Ms Chen questioned if the current clinical supervision that school counsellors have access to is sufficient, especially when “they probably already don’t have many colleagues to bounce off” ideas and experience, as most schools only have one school counsellor.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel added: “Teachers are so busy teaching other lessons that during CCE lessons, we just literally deliver whatever the school gives us. It’s really hard to engage the kids in a manner that is real and that they can fully relate to.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While part of the refreshed CCE syllabus teaches “resilience and social-emotional well-being” - which includes having a sense of gratitude and appreciation - Cindy felt that it perpetuates “toxic positivity”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before we get to resilience there are so many other logical steps a person struggling with his or her mental health can go through - acceptance, for example. We really can't teach resilience through CCE. Inspiring videos and powerpoint slides can only go so far,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "BANGKOK: In recent years, China’s digital economy has seemed like a house undergoing full-scale renovation. At this moment, it appears to be in the demolition stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a series of regulatory smackdowns, the magnitude ranging from sledgehammers to wrecking balls, Beijing has appeared willing to lay waste to entire industries and billion-dollar firms in the interest of rebuilding much of the country’s technology and Internet sectors to align with its objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, casualties have included Ant Group, whose planned initial public offering (IPO) in November 2020 was set to be the largest in history until authorities slammed the brakes and imposed rules forcing the fintech giant to restructure much of its business. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After the ride-hailing company Didi Global reportedly ignored warnings not to go through with its June public offering in the United States, Beijing responded swiftly with a thorough probe of the firm’s data security practices, ordering the removal of Didi apps and mini-programmes by the country’s major Internet platforms. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, Ant and Didi seem to be enjoying far more favourable circumstances than China’s private and online education providers, who now face what appears to be a virtual ban on their entire industry. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As speculation intensifies as to which sector may be next, investors in healthcare to real estate to gaming are all spooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities in Beijing look to be unleashing an all-out barrage on the country’s largest digital and private-sector players. And the current manoeuvres are not without method. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The demolition and potential reconstruction of China’s digital economy is being undertaken through various bureaucratic entities within the apparatus of the state, yet the interests of those entities are known to both align and conflict with one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequentially, there is now a rapidly expanding list of state regulatory agencies that find themselves with expanding budgets, scale and power to accomplish their aims. Some of the most prominent include the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 2011, CAC, China’s Internet watchdog, has largely served the role of policing the country’s heavily censored online content. However, as the Internet has grown in prominence, so has the CAC. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With what appears to be an expanding mandate in overseeing data and network security, the CAC’s role in Didi’s IPO debacle may have set a new precedent, ensuring that any of the country’s tech firms hoping to go public can only do so with the CAC’s approval.      \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "According to industry observers, the CAC’s move is part of a long-term process of establishing a secure quasi-public infrastructure system for controlling China’s data that limits monopolistic behaviour by tech giants, making room for innovation and competitive disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As China’s top market regulator, SAMR has demonstrated its ability to wield wide-ranging authority over the country’s private sector through an expansive interpretation of anti-trust law. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 2018 through the merger of three existing agencies, Beijing’s new super-regulator is perhaps most famous for fining online commerce company Alibaba US$2.8 billion for its anti-competitive “forced exclusivity” practices and for blocking the merger of Huya and DouYu, two US-listed gaming platforms.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For much of the last decade, China experienced a historic flowering of its fintech industry. As Alibaba and Tencent’s online platforms facilitated cashless transactions and digital lending with ease, the country’s startup ecosystem boomed with seemingly countless ventures in areas such as peer-to-peer lending and blockchain technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet as such explosive growth often circumvented China’s notoriously sluggish state banks, it posed a challenge to the PBOC’s control over the country’s financial and monetary systems. Partly spurred on by a series of scandals in the later years of China’s fintech bubble, the PBOC has spent much of the past few years regaining control over the economy from the tech sector. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its highly publicised investigation of Ant Group following the firm’s cancelled IPO is one of a number of recent actions that send a clear signal about who in fact is the master of the yuan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Though much of Beijing’s beefed-up regulatory enforcement has been targeted at the tech sector, emphasising data security, anti-trust and fintech, there are signs that this may be merely the beginning of widespread regulatory scrutiny and restructuring across the private sector and economy as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "President Xi Jinping appears to be envisioning a stage in China’s development that some observers have compared to America’s progressive era under Theodore Roosevelt: A period of wealth redistribution to correct the excesses of a “gilded age”. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a highly publicised Aug 17 meeting, Xi spoke of a need to restrain “unreasonable income”, hike wages and grow the middle class, signalling that an expanded taxation regime and further curbs on corporate power (and expansion of regulatory power) are likely to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The long-term stated objectives of Xi and his regulatory forces are ambitious and admirable. However, as in the case of any home renovation, to demolish requires a very different set of skills and tools than to rebuild. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Basic Nutrition\n",
      "\n",
      "It's quite well known that nutrition is one of, if not the, most important factors of bodybuilding. I'd like to give a basic breakdown of some of the more basic aspects that everyone should be aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for a very basic breakdowns, all food consist of: carbs, proteins, and fats. Again...this is on a very basic level (as it all gets much more complex).\n",
      "\n",
      "Protien (4 calories/gram) - Protien is the building block of muscle, so it's no wonder why bodybuilders are recomended to take in 1-1.5g/lb of bodyweight....minimum. There has been a debate that has still never been solved claiming that high protien diets aren't necessary, and even dangerous, and that high protien diets produce more of a placebo effect. But for every study which shows high protien diets are not effective, there is another showing that they are. This is still being debated, and most likely will continue to be debated for a very long time. It is believed that high protien diets are dangerous because it requires a lot of water to digest protien, a simple answer to this problem is to drink more water. It is also believed to put strain on the kidneys, again, drinking a lot of water will help with this problem. Though most of these claims of protien being dangerous are outdated, people still choose to believe, and preach this theory. Though there seems to be no real threat, i figured this debate was worth mentioning to clear up any concerns that a new bodybuilder might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carbohydrates (4 calories/gram) - Carbs are much more complicated than protien because each carb source is different and should be used in a different way. Here's a basic run down:\n",
      "1) Slow-Digesting Carbs(natural): yams, wild rice, beans, oats, fruts...all natural carbs are in this category. These are ideal for most people as they are digested slowly providing you with energy throught the day. They also don't spike insulin levels which is very unwanted for if you're metabolism isn't on the freakishly fast side, you're going to be gaining some fat.\n",
      "2) Fast-Digesting Carbs(man-made): white bread, bagels, white rice, cold cerials, fruit juices, and other man-made carbs. These carbs hit the blood stream quicker and produce an insulin spike, which is generally only of use post-workout. \n",
      "3) Bodybuilders with excess bodyfat should consume slow-digesting carbs\n",
      "4) If you are low in bodyfat and have a hard time putting on weight, fast-digesting carbs can be usefull as you will be able to eat more of them and it will help stimulate appetite. \n",
      "5) Take in slow-digesting carbs before training because your body will need them to sustain energy. \n",
      "6) Immediately after training, take in fast-digesting carbs. They will spike insulin levels switching your muscles from a catabolic to an anabolic phase. Durring this phase after training you can take in up to .7 g of carbs/lb.\n",
      "7) It is recomended to get 2.5-3 times your bodyweight in carbs/day. Use the information above to determine what sources you should get these carbs from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fat (9 calories/gram): This is the most feared of all of these 3 nutrients because common logic is, if someone doesn't want to store excess fat in their body, why would they eat something that bears the same name? The thing that most people don't know is, fat is as essential to a propper diet as anything else, it's just a matter of taking in the right fats. First of all, fat is very essential as it serves to keep you warm, and more importantly cushions your organs. The body also calls on fat for energy. Fats are probably the least complicated of all of these nutritents, as there really isn't much to say about them. Many people don't even count fat calories, they just limit the amount of saturated fat which they take in. I will say this though; it is very important to make sure you are getting all of your essential fatty acids. These are fats which the body needs and not just stored as fat as saturated fats are. You can get your essential fatty acids from fish, nuts, flax seeds, almonds, and avacados, just to name a few. With fat taken from these sources, you can supply your body with the fats that it needs without fearing your waist line expanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "I included the calories/gram of all of those because, though you should be more concerned with where your calories are coming from, you should be sure to eat 200-300 calories over your maintnance levels every day in order to grow. If you wish to find out your maintnance levels, take a week where you just eat to maintain. Eat when you're hungry, and stop when you're not hungry anymore. Right down everything you eat in detail, and at the end of the week, add all of the calories up, and devide it by 7 (because there are 7 days in a week). The number you get is your maintnance calorie level. Add 200-300 calories on to that and you're set.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you are just getting into bodybuilding, you are probably eating roughly 3 meals/day, with the occasional snack thrown in....well in bodybuilding, that crow won't caw \n",
      "\n",
      "It has been understood for a very long time that you must change your eating patern from 3 large meals per day, to several small ones. There are several reasons as to why this method is best. First of all, your body gets a constant supply of nutrients throughout the day, so you can constantly feed your muscles (as they are metaboliclly active, and you're sure to have atleast 1 muscle group that is still recoving from it's previous workout) and grow. Another reason is because your body can only digest so much protien at a time. It varies from person to person but it's generally around 30g (though you can take in more upon waking up and post-workout). If you were to eat 3 meals a day, that would mean your body would only be digesting around 90g of protien and the rest would serve as empty calories to be stored as fat. Here are some sample meal plans that a bodybuilder may follow. Feel free to use these as guides, but they must be customized to tailor your caloric needs and schedual. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Meal One - six-egg omlette with cheese, whol-grain toast, fruit, 1-2 glasses of milk\n",

If you sit here, people walking by our restaurant may think it is full and would not come in.\"  I looked around and there were at least 3 empty tables and no waiting customers.  I told her if there are customers waiting for the seats, I'd gladly wait outside.  So I stay put.  Moments later, a Caucasian customer walked in.  She seated him next to me and said: \"There is customer now.  You have to wait outside.\"   WTF!  I then told her I am also a customer too.  If I have to wait outside, then they can change my take-out order to dine in instead.  I told the gentleman sitting next to me about what's happening and asked if he mind I stay seated for another 5 minutes. He had no objection at all.  Then I told the waitress I already asked their customer and he doesn't mind me sitting with him.  At the end , they gave me my lunch and I left.

We had a new waitress yesterday who was sweet and adorable, Ashley? I think was her name. Pumpkin pancakes and potato pancakes were delicious. Everything was good and I would have given 5 stars EXCEPT The horrible blonde hostess woman who seemed to get pleasure by being rude to customers as they were paying and leaving. She is awful. She is outwardly rude to customers and seems to gain pleasure by being so....we left a 30% cash tip for our waitress the other day...she thought it was her place to advise me that I was \" required\" to tip on my credit card at minimum of 15%...not her place to tell me how much or that a tip was required. A tip is a courtesy, not a requirement. We always tip at minimum 20 to 30% depending on service, so her advice would have cost our wonderful server. The hostess needs to learn customer service, basic kindness, general politeness if that is possible. She took a 5 star experience and dropped it to a 3...had our service been off or the food not as good, she could have lost you good customers. TRAIN HER..PLEASE! the next time I hear her being rude or condescending to myself or another customer, I promise I will be calling her out on her rudeness and to management. She is a major detriment to your business.  To other customers, be aware that the awful hostess woman will be rude, will tell you how to tip and will make snide comments about you ...but the food is good and most of the waitstaff is good...so ignore the crabby hostess, she has a lot of bad days, and enjoy your breakfast or lunch. 2016-09-08 01:15:34 3.5416307\n",

I knew they didn't take reservations on the weekend but wanted to see if they would make an exception since we were a large group and it was a milestone birthday (knew the chances were slim). Instead what I was told was how large groups aren't of value to them as they don't make as much money and that they are in the business of flipping tables and doing volume so don't care about groups and don't even want groups! This was said to a customer!!?!! Any owner that basically says to their customer that they aren't as valuable as they  are only focused on making as much money as possible makes me seriously question how they run the rest of their business. Perhaps the owner forgot that the key to have the large group as repeat business is to give fantastic customer service. So if you don't want to support a business that treats their customers like they are just numbers, then join me in boycotting this establishment. Luckily their competition right in the same plaza was happy to take our business and equally appalled at how we were treated:) 2016-03-26 22:34:26 3.5187435\n",

Most locals think it's far, but actually not a bad drive at all.  The customer service was great.  We sat at the bar and played some games.  Our money got stuck and the bar tender quickly called a repair guy who came and opened the machine and gave us our money and we continued playing.   Now on to the food.... can I say sooooooo delicious! The portions were big well at least to me so I didn't finish it all and I was sharing with my husband.  The drinks were made to perfection and the other locals at the bar were very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday and they bought him a Yeager and redbull.  He is not a big drinker, but he enjoyed the drink. All around 5 stars for customer service, location, and the other customers.  We went on my husband's birthday which was Feb. 22 and I must say we will be returning.  We live in summerlin, but we enjoy this location the most. 2016-03-03 20:41:03 3.5187435\n",

I have always changed my own oil and on rare occasion,  have had to take my vehicle to a shop to have the oil plug loosened,  always free of charge.  I decided to stop by Meineke today after having some tires changed next door.  This particular Meineke was dead with only one ore two cars being worked on.  I went to the gentleman at the counter to ask if they could loosen the plug,  at which point the shop manager,  who was lazily lounging in one of the customer chairs in the lobby piped up and said \"No, I don't usually do that\".  Well I don't usually pay people who laze around in the customer waiting area to change the oil on my car either.  I stopped by Jiffy Lube,  who had plenty of customers,  and they loosened my oil plug with no nonsense and no charge.  Good luck Meineke!

However, once my promotional deal ended I was paying double. I called and spoke to a very kind customer service representative, but she was unable to lower my bill because I was not a new customer. All of the promotions are for new customers only. Annoying. I canceled my service and switched providers which cut my bill in half. After paying what I thought was my last and final CenturyLink bill I received another bill! Disconnection fees. What a rip off! And I returned my rented equipment myself to the CenturyLink store. I called about disconnection fees as well. The only thing they could offer was that she would put a note on my account that I was never informed about the fee.

We were the only table dining-in so I was a little bit leary but it was still early (5pm) and we were all hungry. After about 20 minutes anotherly elderly couple came to dine-in. So only 2 tables going in the entire place. I must admit the food was good, very fresh ingriedients and nicely presented. HOWEVER the dam waitress wouldn't stop texting on her cell phone the entire time in the dining room in plain view of the  5 customers that were in there. So we were sitting there with empty glasses and could not get our drinks refilled and when we did manage to finally get her attention she seemed pissed and discombobulated that we interupted her Texting session. When trying to get the check we actually had to go up front to the manager cause miss Texty wouldnt look up from her phone. Ironically the Manager was sitting up front on her laptop searching for Christmas sale items. I was always under the impression that the Customer was supposed to be #1 not the Cell Phone/Computer. So if you want to go and recieve awful service from a 16 year old waitress texting while she's supposed to be servicing customers this is the place to go. I only gave 2 stars cause the food was actually pretty decent. We will never return due to the EXTREME lack of customer service knowledge on managements part and front line staff. 2012-11-26 23:44:36 3.2555804\n",

There were no spoons or knives to eat. They made me to wait for a while to get the cutlery. By the time I started eating the food was already very cold.

I called back this week to order a tire for my other vehicle & set-up an appt for install today.  When I got to the store, I was told that there were 5 appts ahead of me & it would be close to an hour...even with the appt I had made.

I drove 3 mins to meineke and stood in line.

He said no we can't do your oil change today that's not how it works and proceeded to lecture me in front of other customers about booking appt online and how your system operates. I wanted to tell him that online your appointment system is very vague and DOES NOT say how long you will need my car but instead I told him to cancel everything and walked out. I suggest that you train him better with how to talk professional to customers or else you will lose business. 4 people in line behind me walked out and talked to me about how rude this guy was. the GM of this company needs to be aware of his professionalism while at work! 2017-09-21 18:12:32 3.161017\n",

Out of an order of wings 4 of them were so small that they should have been thrown away instead of served to customers. I uploaded a picture for you to see for yourself. Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!\n",

You can constantly hear them yelling at each other in Vietnamese and it makes you feel very uncomfortable during your entire experience. Kim's so called professionalism should be accounted for and I would not recommend this nail salon.

The nail bar is separated from the pedicure stations by a partial wall that includes a water fixture (faux fish tank).

Other customers in the area appeared very relaxed, and the general feel of the employees was warm and inviting. \n",

The steaks are done perfectly, the mashed potatoes are the best, and the bread basket offerings are wonderful. Second - the atmosphere is perfect.  It is intimate and cozy with the added bonus of piano background music. Third - people like Todd (manager) and Frederick (server), make you feel important and wanted.  Frederick is attentive to your every need and Todd moves around the restaurant greeting his customers which makes all customers feel so welcomed.  I can't tell you the best attribute of Waverlys because the food, atmosphere and people make this a perfect dining experience.  I love you Waverlys!! 2015-02-01 17:20:18 3.0631812\n",

I called more than two hours after my appointment time to check on the car as I hadn't heard anything. The response was that he did not know the situation with my car and has not been looked at because I brought my car in at the beginning of the morning, at about 745am for my 11am appointment. I was told that I \"changed the dynamics of the day\" by dropping my vehicle off early. Does not make any bit of sense to me. And there was definitely no additional customer service to make up for that. Service was a simple oil change and to check my low air pressure light. Poor time efficiency and quality of care.

I found a white plastic-like piece of something in my dosa which I spent about good five minutes experimenting with my guest to see whether it was harmful or not. While I concluded that it was most probably ok to finish eating the food and that what I found is something that is not non-veg (as i'm a vegetarian!), I was still disturbed by the experience. Consequently, I called the waitress and informed about it. She took the white plastic-like object from me and had a discussion with the mangers and owner right in front of me (everyone made eye contact and/or starred at me while having a discussion, lol!). Waitress came back and said that I could have gotten another dosa but since I finished eating what I ordered i'm no longer eligible AND  that it won't be taken off the bill bc they are already doing their anniversary promotion and so they cannot offer another discount. I was really upset because a) this whole thing interrupted my dinner, b) interrupted my dinner date with my guest, c) caused a lot of stress d) wasted a whole lot of my time, e) and to make matters worse they offered me a deal which apparently had expired because I continued to eat the dosa - this is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from a restaurant manager!! and I was extremely shocked to hear it come from a restaurant that charges a hefty price!\n",

I told him how much i'm disappointed and upset by their customer service. I raised all of the above points as well as the fact that all complaints should be handled directly by the manager and the least that could've been done is give an apology instead of arguing with the customer with a ridiculous point!! What was evident from the conversation is that the managers and especially the owner have no customer service skills and they have no interest in looking after customer satisfaction. David was simply using a cookie-cutter approach to the problem instead of looking at it in an individual basis and focusing on customer satisfaction. He said that his team of staff figured out that the white plastic-like object was in fact a piece of flattened dry rice. What they failed to do is inform that to me so that at least it would have put me at ease instead leaving me to feel that i could've potentially eaten something harmful. What was really interesting in the conversation with David is that no where in our conversation he took the ownership for their mistake which includes but not limited to: a) sending a waitress to address complaint instead of  a manger, b) not informing that the object is in fact rice and not something harmful, c) not offering apology, d) offering a deal that apparently expired because i finished eating the last bit of dosa i had in my plate, e) telling me that because they were doing a promotion for their anniversary, they cannot offer another discount for me (which was a very foolish thing to say!).. etc. \n",

The waitress we had was awesome. She was quick to order our drinks and food when we were ready. She was great at connecting with her customers and didn't make it seem hard or awkward at all. Overall, food was fresh, affordable, came out fairly quick. Because of her amazing customer service she got a great tip and a phone number too lol. First experience was definitely a 5/5 stars. \n",

We got seated in less than 5 minutes, ordered our drinks and food. This service we had was pretty good, understood the words that we ordered but not actually getting it right. We aren't picky customers so we didn't care that much. We enjoyed our meal even if it was very busy. Busy or not, servers were quick and so were the food. But because of the misunderstanding of our orders, the second visit was a 3.5/5 starts. \n",

      " Q9epWOUpamVLvIstJJmaQg Eat fresh. Eat local. Eat healthy. All great goals for 2018. And honeygrow checks all the boxes. Basically a sleek fast-casual, farm-to-table joint. Located in the ever changing and gentrifing East Liberty, this new spot offers diners unmatched customization via kiosk (or mobile app) of MTO stir fry, salads, fruit cups (aka honeybars) and cold-pressed juices. I appreciate the level of detail that went into the touch screen menu, which made meal customization more transparent and easy to accomplish. However, less tech savvy folks may find themselves a bit overwhelmed and the overall user experience cumbersome -- if one of the kiosks is down, it can take awhile to order during peak times. Nonetheless, the wait time during this visit was reasonable. More importantly, the food was delicious! Fresh, quality ingredients simply taste better. Your palate will thank you, but your wallet may not depending on how custom you made your meal. I was also delighted to see non-Coke/non-Pepsi products available at the fountain...Maine Root FTW! The sleek, minimalistic interior design was open, bright and inviting though a little more seating wouldn't be a bad idea. And a friendly staff is always a welcome change. Lots to love at hg, so I look forward to future meals here! 2018-03-11 16:50:13 3.0122845\n",

      " nQeQNvDJ7hdg_3nvEy94Tw I am extremely disappointed with the customer service I have received today. Not only was I not informed at the time of account cancellation that I was going to be charged full price for my services as I lost my discount when I didn't have the account for a full month, but am being charged two extra days at a prorated full price of services I did not use. I spoke to a representative weeks before and was told I could opt to have my account cancelled when I returned my equipment. Not only was that not true, but I was not able to reach anyone through the phone number given to me by the store clerk that day and had to call the next morning. Then, I was informed it takes 24 hours for it to be cancelled, having them charge me an extra day of services I was obviously not using as I had already returned my equipment. So now, because of incorrect information provided to me, I am being charged these extra two days because of Century Link's incompetence. After being a loyal customer for over 2 years, I am shocked to be treated in such a manner. With them not \"believing\" me that I tried calling the day I returned my equipment and not being able to \"prove\" that I did not use the service those extra days (without my equipment and as I drove across the country, no less), they can't bother to credit me for those days. Must be nice that I was enrolled in autopay and they could just debit that automatically from my account, right? Did I mention I would've kept my services if they were available in my new state? I wouldn't return to Century Link as a customer knowing how they value loyal customers even I had the option again. \n",

They acted as though I could not comprehend simple words and phrases despite my prompt and polite responses.  By the time I was done with this prick (overweight, 50's, mustache, shit eating grin) I came close to just tearing up the contract and punching him in the face.  Why on god's green earth you'd want to treat a paying customer like that I have no idea, and I really don't care - there is NO excuse for it.

It's bad enough that they don't take credit cards and don't even tell customers in advanced but to charge customers for using debit card as well??  Here is another example of a business who indirectly just wants cash.  Probably reports only a portion of their earnings to CRA.  Honestly, I have never been to ANY restaurants that have this type of money-grabbing business practice as a way to boost their revenue.\n",

      "3. Food- good but nothing to die for especially when they charge prices that are more than other places I've been to.  I ordered to Roti Curry, Curry chicken and Chicken Vermicelli.  Vermicelli isn't really authentic.  They used the 'Gui Lin' noodles instead of the true rice noodle (mei-fun) that most other places use and the chicken portion is very small. \n",

I replied regular. All of a sudden \"they were busy\" and couldn't fit me in. I asked within the next 3.5 hours that they're open, there's no availability? I wasn't planning on coming back or staying but I was just blown away by the blatant unprofessionalism and poor customer service. He stated maybe come back tomorrow.

We ordered off the all you can eat menu and didn't get the majority of the food we ordered!! We had to ask the server what was going on and she said the chef lost our order list!!! She then comes back with the list and apologizes... This was about 1.5 hours after we had placed the initial order. After such a wait we had no appetite...especially since the sushi itself was very low quality!! I've been to prince prior to this experience and didn't mind it. Be aware it has gone WAY DOWNHILL. Save your time and money and go to Heart sushi.. Much better food and customer service. By the way...after such a horrible experience...the manager which was not there and had to be called via phone only offered 10% off the bill. 2016-04-09 02:31:49 2.9793203\n",

      " y85fZus2OD93EkdK7NOh_g honeygrow is another fast-casual restaurant where you can customize your dish--either stir fry or salad in this case. If you're looking for a salad, I'd suggest going to hello bistro instead; the ambiance might not be as great, but you have more topping options and get more salad for your money, and it tastes better too. The salads and the stir fry here are pretty good, but I just can't get over the fact that they don't put prices for their non-custom menu items. The most recent time I went, my fall harvest salad was $12 (there wasn't even meat in it), and my friends' stir frys were around $15. Seems a bit steep to me. Three stars because the touch screen is easy and nice for when you want minimal human interaction and the restaurant is very clean and modern. 2017-12-03 02:04:30 2.9793203\n",

They said the delivery person came but no one answered the door; we live in a small home and we would have heard the door bell loud and clear.  Extremely disappointing. We wanted to support local business and this one generally had good reviews.  Wish they would improve their delivery and customer service.

I have been a customer for America's Tire Company/Discount Tire for many years and have bought a number of set of tires. So when I saw they had a deal for Black Friday 2015, I was excited to get a deal. The rebate is one that I had to email in and ran into some delays, however I received a rebate check. While their add seemed to imply a $100 rebate for best quality tires or $75 for better rated tires, my rebate check was for $50. That is less than 10% of what I paid. The tires are good and the customer service was good but I am disappointed with such a low rebate for a Black Friday deal especially when competitors were offering buy 3 get one free. Moral learned from my story, if you see what looks like a deal, make sure to shop around if price is matters to you. 2016-03-13 04:38:29 2.8246589\n",

Instead of one person taking orders, and 2 person handing the food out to the customer, they have 3 of them doing the same thing and often time confused themselves. How can you get confuse at the things you are doing repeatedly? Not sure how hard is it for them to get the naan, sauce, drinks and salad dressing. I mean doesn't take a rocket scientist to do that. And the big no-no was when they handled the food with their bare hands and then touched everywhere in the counter and the cash register. I mentioned several times, please don't place your finger in the food, please use a gloves or tongs, they just ignore it and continue putting their finger into everyone's food and then use the same finger to touch the cash register and anywhere around the counter.

I think this is an OWNERSHIP issue and not wait staff.    The reason I say this is because they don't assign just ONE person to your table but rather serve you as a group.   Thus no single person seemed to have responsibility for the table.   Perhaps a better approach to management and opportunity for each wait staff to take personal ownership for their customers will result in competition and increased incentive to please customers, earn tips, and garner repeat business for the establishment.     If they insist on waiting on customers as a group then the MANAGER of the group needs to motivate, coach, and develop the team better.    It's always the fault of the manager when a whole group is that way. 2010-06-23 03:05:24 2.8052223\n",

He said he would take care of it, i watched him put chemicals into the pool and within 24 hours our pool was dark swampy green. Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until Monday AFTERNOON to take a look at our pool that their person turned green.

I witnessed some employees making fun of customers and laughing. A young lady said \"I only offer the needle tip ejuice to people I like. If I don't like them, I don't offer it to them\" and she laughed. Also they seemed to be so involved with personal conversations, customers are getting neglected. The owner that I met the first time I went there seemed really nice. He was awesome, but when he isn't there to monitor his employees, I think the whole demeanor changes :/  unfortunately, I will not be returning to make any further purchases after my experiences.

I came to this Discount Tire at the recommendation of my brother in law, who lives nearby.  I am so grateful he did!  The staff are courteous and friendly.  Eric is the best!  He not only quickly got the ball rolling, but gave me a discount equal to the rebate I could have gotten.  Since I am terrible about sending in for my rebates, this is extra special.  In addition to that, he referred me to a local shop for my alignment and oil change.  He called ahead to make sure they had the equipment needed for my old Odyssey and let them know I was coming once my tires are on.  I am so impressed.  Many businesses could learn from the customer service and just plain kindness shown me here today.

After a stressful blow out on the 202 freeway, my first instincts was to call Discount Tire for a replacement, since I had purchased tires from them twice before. I was quoted one price over the phone, which had convinced me to drive down to the shop on my donut. When I arrived I was told that the total price was going to be an additional $50, not including the warranty. Not only was I floored at the increase in price, but I was also told by Joey that I needed to replace another tire ASAP, since the tread was at a 4. I walked outside and started to shop around to other local businesses. I did end up going elsewhere, where they charged me the actual price quoted, which was in turn cheaper than Discount. In addition, the competitor informed me that the thread on my other three tires were just fine, none were even close to a 4, but instead all an 8. I will not be returning due to the dishonesty when I was in a vulnerable state. Big O Tires surpassed your customer service 100%! 2017-01-23 16:25:16 2.6852622\n",

Door probably should have been locked until that time. No one greeted us, and I had to ask if they were open.  The young girl working told us they weren't open until 12. That was it.  No welcome and/or have a seat and we will serve you when everything is ready.  We almost left because of the response or lack of, but chose to wait since this is one of our favorite poke restaurants. Time passed and shortly after 12 another customer walked in and began ordering. What?  We were sitting down the whole time, and not one employee let us know they were ready for us to order. We were both extremely disappointed and left. With so many poke restaurants popping up all over the area, this one needs to improve on their customer service. We will probably give them another try.

After going on a Saturday night for my birthday I will definitely be frequenting this place more often. The bartenders Andi and Chris are very polite and have a great enthusiastic personality. They are very attentive to your needs. Highly recommend going Saturday nights with Andi and Chris! Not a dull moment. 2016-05-15 16:19:01 2.6397219\n",

      " rtcwq1nrb8xNnR8t1pHqwQ Recently sent a girlfriend some get well flowers. Unfortunately, I didn't like the first arrangement they sent to her. In my opinion it looked sparse. Although my girlfriend loved them, I wasn't happy and called the florist to complain. No questions asked, they sent her another amazing bouquet and had them delivered within the hour. I would definitely recommend this florist and will use them in the future. Can't pay for better customer service. 2017-01-25 14:47:26 2.6397219\n",

      " 5NnimfihcfeWh6kFBX0T1w Brought my car here to have my radiator hoses and serpentine belt replaced after the dealership quoted me $850. In the process of removing the upper hose the outlet on the radiator broke. They had to replace the radiator as well now. Since they couldn't determine whether or not it broke because it was old and brittle, or if it was their bad and accidentally broke it off, they replaced the radiator for free! This was my first time coming here and I will now be a repeat customer! Great job! 2018-02-20 02:52:11 2.6397219\n",

The lady at the counter was super rude.  \"Operations manager\" was arguing with an old lady loudly at the table next to us and when I mentioned my problem to him, he just walked away without saying anything.  Maybe cause they're in a casino they don't really care about customer service because there's always another tourist that doesn't know better to stop by but I'm a local and will definitely never return.

I  saw other customers had bad experience but I didn't know the details but after what I  experienced, I feel bad for them too.

Their hours are great because they are open late and NEVER rush you out or close early. We arrived at 9pm and Dan did my moms gel manicure/pedicure. Julie did my gel pedicure and Ti did my manicure.

I have to say I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. The baked beans were down right horrible. I gave them two stars because of the free soft serve ice cream that you get with every order. :) 2009-08-03 23:09:01 1.0\n",

      " a_3pIkYggF1BUUVrRco2Vg Don't ask me why I keep frequenting chain restaurants -- I must be a glutton for punishment.  So, I've been to this Outback a few times before, I used to order the prime rib, but it had come out so fatty the past few times that I stopped ordering it.  Last night, I met a couple friends here and this time I ordered the Outback Special Sirloin with the lobster and mushroom topping (an extra $3.95)  for the more \"indulgent steak experience,\" as stated on the menu.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So the appetizer and salad came out fine, no problems thus far.  Then the steak came out.  It was cooked fine, but they forgot to include the lobster and mushroom topping for the more indulgent steak experience.  I told my server nicely that they had forgotten the topping and he assured me that it would be right out. The steak was decent and cooked correctly, however I was disappointed because the lobster and mushroom topping came out 10 minutes after my steak, which was cold by now and the \"topping\"  wasn't really a lobster topping with mushrooms, it was more of a lobster bisque with mushrooms.  If I had known it was going to be so disappointing, I wouldn't have bothered to wait for it while my steak got cold.  It would have been nice if the server apologized and took the \"topping\" off my bill (yes, it was just $3.95 but it's the principle of the matter), or offered a free dessert, but there was no accountability.  I don't expect to have another indulgent steak experience at Outback anytime soon. 2010-08-23 22:32:18 1.0\n",

I waited for our server for several minutes.  I tried to go the bar to order a drink, but because I had said hello to my group of friends already at the tables, the bartender said I was not allowed to open a tab unless I was going to sit at the bar. I never got a reason on why this was the case, but it was very frustrating. I finally got my beer from the server after several more minutes.

They were not willing to work with me. I ended up having to express to the bar tenders that our group of 35+ people was going to have to leave and get service somewhere else if the situation did not improve. We kept talking with no progress, but eventually a manager came over. The manager assigned us several more waiters, which eased the frustration in our group.

It would have been really great to wrap most of the grilled meat in large lettuce leaves with a few other raw veggies added in like I've seen being eaten on most Korean food shows. Now that would have been a worth-while experience. Presentation of the raw food seemed hap-hazard and bland and that's noticeable in some of the pictures from other yelpers, most of the items from the AYCE option we choose was mainly red or white in color.

That's almost saying that you straight up, don't care. How on earth there was a mix up, is beyond me. Even on a Friday/Saturday night with the place packed that wouldn't be okay. Me and my girlfriend got our drinks after 45 minutes and ordered our food. We got boneless wings/fritters and they tasted like dirty fryer oil, as did the breaded chicken sandwiches. The Hummus was really good though. It honestly deserves 1 star, but the fact that we had a lot of that taken off our bill was nice at least. 2016-01-05 07:18:58 1.0\n",

      " fkGfVPNunZESmJEpOaMe9Q I stopped In here the other day because I was in Henderson and found myself hungry. I love the breads at Great Harvest Bread Company so I decided to try them for lunch. Big mistake! I was on the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich so that is what I ordered.  That, however, is not what I received. What I received was a cheese sandwich that had been put through an oven on a conveyer, Albeit the cheese was melted the bread was as white and untoasted as when they sliced it off the loaf. I inquired of the young lady at the counter as to why this was the case, (A grilled cheese should come out with a golden brown, crispy, crunchy and delicious exterior crust. Which is created by the application of butter to the exterior of the bread before you GRILL it.)  I was told that they put there garlic butter on the inside of the sandwich so as not to mess up the grill...what grill? there is only the oven with a conveyor belt. This is inadequate, to say the least. That's fine if you want to do it that way but don't call it a grilled cheese sandwich, it is not!!! Perhaps your employer would think about purchasing a Panini grill or something that would produce the desired exterior. \n",

      "To the young woman who helped me, don't ask me have a had the sandwich here before because clearly I have not! I have a completely different idea of what a grilled cheese sandwich is, as I'm sure most people would. It was not the warm cheese sandwich that I got.\n",

This place's location can't be beat so we decided out of convenience to give it a try it. Once you enter, there's a lower level and an upstairs. Although not sure what the lower level is for, we headed upstairs. During our visit, Friday evening, the front door was super crowded and we were confused if there was a wait or not - but people were just standing around blocking the door to keep warm? \n",

      "Anyway, we got upstairs and were served immediately. We were surprised at how empty the store was for a Friday night. There were maybe 10 tables max occupied. We were a group of 4 and to our surprise was only given one grill to use (comparing to the other big franchise Chako, which gives 2 grills for 4 people). The waiter came pretty quickly to take our order and drinks. We had the option to choose individual dinner or all you can eat kbbq which was nice. Of course, we went for kbbq as that was our intention of coming. You order all you can eat on a sheet of paper that has all the items. Variety was decent, but vegetables are an additional $3 though. Side dishes were tiny but was nice to have. Food came promptly, however, the first round, we ordered chicken and few others which didn't all come. I think they miss orders on purpose if you order too many? It's really like how other yelpers mentioned, first 15 minutes was okay but the experience goes downhill from there, especially if you come with a party of 4 and everyone's trying to cram all their food on one little grill. I guess it slows down the cooking process so you don't get to eat as much? Anyhow, we had a total of 2 rounds which I see is the norm from the tables beside us. The service was not overall too bad and the servers did attend to us whenever we needed something. We had the grill changed once and they were pretty prompt about it. For the price, I would say it's decent for what you get but it's too bad they don't include dessert like their competitor. Overall, I still prefer Chako and don't think I would return again. \n",

      " Y3yQMD1XLRSECNYkNb3rNw My home warranty company called this company out to replace a salt cell.  Based on my experience, I think this company uses underhanded tactics to double up on its service fees from the home warranty company--which also doubles up my fees, of course.  Read below, and use the lesson here to be careful with your dealings with them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had them out to replace a salt cell under the home warranty.  That weekend the heater for the spa refused to function properly.  I asked Aaron Pools about it and I was told that since it's a heater problem they cannot do anything about it unless I submit a separate home warranty claim specific to the heater.  I did so and told the home warranty people that I believe the incidents are related and also told the Aaron Pools scheduler that the incidents are likely related.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When the Aaron Pools looked at the pool again, I was told that a \"heater bypass valve\" was cranked the wrong way and that I just shouldn't ever mess with that valve.  Of course, I did not mess with that valve--never have--it says \"heater bypass valve\" and until then the heater was working great (used it twice in the month before the service without issue), so why would I move it?  I pointed out that the only person who would have moved that was the technician who replaced the salt cell, so please don't charge me for the second service.  He said that he came out to service, so that's that--the charge was earned (and blamed me for turning the valve, of course--\"do you have a video of [AP technician] turning it?\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "I submitted a complaint to the BBB and the owner of Aaron Pools said \"We did not charge you for any return visit, the home warranty company has determined that a salt cell claim and a heater claim are separate issues. Therefore the home warranty company charged an additional service fee.\"  Of course, this is false--Aaron Pools told me to submit the heater claim--the home warranty company does not care if Aaron Pools fixed the problems causes without charging extra.  The owner suggested that the home warranty company would likely waive the charge.  I called the home warranty company and was told that it cannot waive the charge because it prepays the service companies when each claim comes in.  Obviously Aaron Pools knew that the service fee would not be waived.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is when I realized what I think is probably really going on: A little tweak by a technician on an unprofitable home warranty call--a tweak that the homeowner doesn't know how to fix is an easy way to get a second call out to fix another problem and \"earn\" another service fee.  The owner of Aaron Pools claims that his company is not prepaid for service calls.  At this point, however, I frankly do not believe this statement.  It directly conflicts with what I was told by the home warranty company, and of the two Aaron Pools has displayed greater dishonesty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The lesson for everyone else now is: when something goes wrong after and Aaron Pools service, first look for some easy fix.  Second, do not allow them to pressure you into a second claim--it's the same claim if it resulted from Aaron Pools own actions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "(Side note, it is theoretically possible that the initial cranking of the heater bypass valve was done innocently by the first technician in order to reduce flow to take the salt cell out of the water circuit, and then forgot to turn it back.  But I don't think so, because (1) the owner of the company was dishonest with me--dishonesty appears to be a company policy, (2) if the technician knew enough to crank it out of the way, he'd know enough to crank it back, (3) an honest company would not charge for fixing that, and (4) the heater technician said bypassing the water circuit with the salt cell in it would be mostly ineffective.)  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm giving two stars rather than one because, although dishonest with me on more than one occasion, they did actually switch out the salt cell properly (eventually--it took two tries, the first one they installed either came cracked, or it cracked under load because of the manner in which the technician turned the valves). 2018-04-17 05:50:08 1.0\n",

Our server took our drink order, 10 minutes later my husband was still waiting for his beer as they needed to change the keg and were having issues.... that was fine the problem was the bartender and the server seemed to keep forgetting about it until finally my husband decided to ask for a different beer (server did mention it would be comped because it took so long).  We patiently waited for the server to come take our order, she didn't write it down and while I noticed her talking to another server when going back to enter the order she forgot and asked another server to come and ask what we ordered.  After serving our dinner she never came over to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything, or of my husband wanted another beer (no up sale at all).  She seemed more interested in talking to her co-workers than working.  I'm not a hard customer to please but when mistakes are made, they are best made and easily forgiven when the restaurant is busy and the servers are working.

Yesterday we went in to get a loaf of their \"day old\" cheddar garlic loaf.  They had one there and when we paid for it they charged full price vs. the normal 1/2 price for day old.  When I asked about the price we were informed that \" the bread needs to have been baked 24 hours before in order to be day old\".  I then asked what time they normally bake their bread at this location as the others bake all of theirs early in the morning.  The young lady replied that it was put on the rack at 10AM on Thursday.  I noted that it was 3PM on Friday so the 24 hours had definitely passed.  She then changed her story and indicated that the loaf would go on the \"day old\" rack on Saturday morning - nearly 48 hours after it was baked.  So a word to the wise - the \"day old\" bread at this location is really \"two day old\" bread.  Haven't experienced this problem at the other locations. 2011-02-12 23:15:23 1.0\n",

      " SQtRCjpOVwzM-aBWdOx9xA The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule. 2012-08-29 05:00:22 1.0\n",

Never mind that we don't know the exact provenance of branded items, with bags of \"designer\" salad at less than $3, who has time for trivial questions?  As it turns out, there are major inconsistencies with specific brand products with respect to quality control.  On a recent trip, I made the fateful decision of trying what they label Multi-Grain Country Style Bread.  If there is ANY bread out there that tastes more like wood pulp, I'd be really surprised.  Also disappointing was the bulk-sliced white cheddar cheese, albeit the \"lite\" variety, which had a synthetic and bitter quality all it's own.  It also had sticky paper in between each slice which may be a problem for sight impaired or the elderly.  Finally, the low sodium turkey was also low flavor, save for a smoky aftertaste that was likely the last stop on the assembly line where it was packaged.  \n",

Some things I didn't like included the fact that the doors to this room were glass, so if you're sitting near them or facing them, it can be tempting to look out into the lobby/bar area.

My daughter had the mac and cheese and loved it.  My son ordered a kids burger and the bun was so hard he couldn't eat it.  Seriously, the bun was hard as heck and crumbled when you pinched it.  The manager came to the table to see how everything was and I showed him the bun.  He was profusely apologetic and offered to take that off the bill and buy us dessert as well.  We ordered two skillet apple pies and a chocolate thunder.  It took 15 minutes for them to bring it and when it came, it was 1 skillet apple pie and 1 chocolate thunder.

First, the positives were the host sat us quickly, the waitress, Jessica, was excellent, very friendly and attentive, the bread was very good, the salad was good, and the baked potato was also good. Obviously Outback is advertised as a steakhouse, but unfortunately this is where they fall short. My wife ordered the ribeye and it was very thin, no fat to speak of and over cooked so dry, literally no juice or flavor. I ordered the sirloin and shrimp and my steak also was tough like leather, overlooked obviously, and tasteless. We both had to dump on A1 sauce to make eatable. The shrimp really did not have a nice flavor and they were cold. Went to share with wife and she gave them back to me. Not a good sign. If you label yourself a steakhouse you damn sure should make sure you know how to cook steaks. They are a good place for drinks, the onion, a burger or ribs, but please do not order the steaks. Again, Jessica was wonderful so our compliments to her. 2014-08-05 16:14:54 1.0\n",

      " 6tqo8F53g3dHhPqoEi3hIQ In general,  I enjoy Great Harvest Bread Company;  I used to eat at locations before I moved here and love the location on Hualapai.  The is was my first venture to this location.  I happened to see it in route to the furniture store and decided to come back for lunch after my purchase. The first thing I noticed,  no welcome when entering..it's a small thing,  but the extra touch that I'm used to at other locations (the store did a a few people, but not by any means crowded).  There was a young lady ringing people and a couple of people in line;  another passed me to take a sandwich to someone, without so much as a peep. I paused the bread slices awaiting my turn, the young lady went back behind the counter, no comment,  no offer of bread. It was my turn so I went to order; no smiles or kindness from the young lady ringing. ..only appeared to be annoyed as I smiled and told her how much I enjoyed the other location and it was my first time there. I asked a question, and with a roll of the eye, was told they didn't have the item I requested. I ordered the sandwich, she rang order & pushed the receipt to me across the counter (not for signature,  but my copy. .is it too much to ask to hand a customer a receipt ). She did ask me if I would like bread/butter, and when giving it to me did the same,  sat it on the counter near the register and slid it across. All the while with a scowl.  The young lady who brought my sandwich, no smile,  appeared irritated as well. The sandwich was ok; great pesto, but the ends of the bread were harder than I'm used to for some reason and the shredded iceberg lettuce was wilted. Perhaps an off day, perhaps selective with niceties, I don't know,  but the staff did not make a good impression to me at this location. With a range of options for good food, I tend to choose places with good customer service. Perhaps management can work on this with staff and perhaps things may improve...I guess time will tell. 2015-06-26 22:33:31 1.0\n",

Pricey too at $5.95 for a loaf of honey whole wheat. Some employees at the Marks St. location are a bit lackadaisical and take their time serving customers, to the point where I've had to call to workers behind the counter to get their attention. However, they do give out generously-sized samples to anyone who walks through the door, which is always a plus.

I'm thinking maybe there's no lock on top of the box or something so I let it go.

Ordered 2 cheesy Lucy combos and added bacon.  The price was just over $30.00 so already that rang a bit of a bell for me.  I don't mind paying a bit more for something good so although $30 seemed high to me it wasn't that big of a deal.  We sat down and waiting almost half hour for our meal.  Now if it was busy then I can understand but there were only 2 people sitting in the restaurant on that Wednesday afternoon.  Again I don't mind waiting as long as its worth the wait in the end.  Upon receiving my order my first thing were to try the fries.  The fries were awesome.  Fresh cut, salted perfect and nice and crispy.  This made me even more excited to try the burger.  Upon opening the wrapped of the burger all I could see was a bun soaking in burger juice.  The bun became super soggy which was my first turn off.  For the price paid for that burger it was very small.  Burger was tasteless, bacon under cooked, bread soggy.  The middle of the patty was stuffed with cheese and was nice and melted as the pictures showed but didn't do much to help the taste.  After my meal was completed I had the nasty taste of plain unseasoned meat in my mouth for hours.  I give 2 stars only for the fries.  Very disappointed.

I was a little thrown off when my GPS led me past Northlake Mall to Harris Corner, because I initially thought the restaurant was in the shopping center adjacent to the mall, but that's Fox and Hound. Not Hickory Tavern. Anyway, my experience at HT was super underwhelming. Our waitress really tried her best, but it wasn't enough to overcome the rest of the experience. First, the drinks from the bar seemed watered down. I'm not one to expect a double pour when ordering a single, but I also don't expect to order a gin and tonic with hardly any gin. Nobody at the table was pleased with their drink, except for folks who ordered beer and wine. Next, the food. I ordered the wing entree, with tater tots. The tots were room temperature and bland. The wings were ok, but by this point I was a little over the whole thing. There are too many good restaurants in Charlotte to eat mediocre food. I wouldn't go back, but if you decide to go, stick to beer/wine and don't settle for cold tater tots lol. 2018-03-01 12:13:12 1.0\n",

I'll start this off by saying I've never eaten here, only drinks a few times around 9pm-12am on Saturday nights. It has a strange vibe that I don't really like, because every time I've been there late at night for drinks, they close half of the restaurant, their \"dining room\" down. Maybe I'm just bein weird, but it's not really inviting to have half your place shut down, lights off, chairs on tables. I come with a group of friends and last time we walked in, there was 2 tables dirty and dirty drinks lined up on the bar and the bartender told me to sit at the bar...so we almost left but a different waitress cleaned up a table for us.

Note that the word quickly will not be used again in this review.  Once determined that he needed to be admitted, we waited 6 hours for a regular room. In fairness, we were told they were busy and there was a shortage of beds.  The nurses on the 3rd floor (where he currently is) have been very nice. My main complaint and the reason for only 2 stars are the doctors. They. Are. Nonexistent.  The doctor has stopped by twice in 3 days.  We're talking 2 minute visits.  Both times, as we were talking to the doctor, he was busy texting on his phone and acted like he was doing my husband a great favor by gracing us with his presence.  This doctor does not know what is wrong with my husband, nor does he seem to care. There does not seem to be any communication between doctors and nurses. In a nutshell: the ER staff and the nurses are great. The doctors - NOT SO MUCH. 2018-04-08 15:44:37 1.0\n",

We were the only table dining-in so I was a little bit leary but it was still early (5pm) and we were all hungry. After about 20 minutes anotherly elderly couple came to dine-in. So only 2 tables going in the entire place. I must admit the food was good, very fresh ingriedients and nicely presented. HOWEVER the dam waitress wouldn't stop texting on her cell phone the entire time in the dining room in plain view of the  5 customers that were in there. So we were sitting there with empty glasses and could not get our drinks refilled and when we did manage to finally get her attention she seemed pissed and discombobulated that we interupted her Texting session. When trying to get the check we actually had to go up front to the manager cause miss Texty wouldnt look up from her phone. Ironically the Manager was sitting up front on her laptop searching for Christmas sale items. I was always under the impression that the Customer was supposed to be #1 not the Cell Phone/Computer. So if you want to go and recieve awful service from a 16 year old waitress texting while she's supposed to be servicing customers this is the place to go. I only gave 2 stars cause the food was actually pretty decent.

      "\n",
      "There were supposed to be 4 potstickers but there were only 3. At $5.25, those 3 dumplings were pricey. Apparently somebody in the kitchen has trouble counting because our $4.50 order of crab puffs was also missing one (ie, it had 4 instead of 5). The Teriyaki beef skewers (you get 4 of them) were dry, dry dry. They were like eating beef jerky on a stick, only these were tasteless. They were tough and way overcooked or maybe they had just been sitting around for a few days. Definitely not worth $2 a piece. \n",

      "The honey dipped ribs (4 of them) were a nice size but a little tough. The bbq sauce covering the ribs was tomato-based and I expected it to be a little sweet (it is called HONEY DIPPED ribs, after all) but it was pretty bland. I did not taste sweet on those ribs. The portion was a good size for an appetizer, though. \n",

      "The Walnut Shrimp was probably the smallest portion of the entrees and way overpriced. I could count on 4 fingers the number of average size shrimp in there.

      "The Beef and Broccoli was supposed to be prepared in a garlic brown sauce (according to the menu). The sauce had a light reddish tinge (maybe from some tomato sauce?) and there was no garlic flavor in this sauce. There was very little flavor of any kind. I expected to taste soy sauce, ginger, even pepper but nothing. I've had Beef and Broccoli at other restaurants before and I've also made it at home and this was the blandest by far. The broccoli was fresh and had a nice crunch and color to it and the beef was tender but cut into miniscule pieces, as if by cutting them so small and spreading them around, it'll look like you have a lot more beef than you actually do. At $13.50, the portion size was adequate for one person even though there seemed to be more broccoli and very little beef. \n",

      "Finally, the House Fried Rice was the only dish that actually had some flavor to speak of. The aroma and color of the entree was appetizing.

First clue that it wasn't going to go well ... no chopsticks on the table and we were never offered any.  Second clue ... after ordering, the waitress said, \"That comes with white rice.\"  To say that to a Chinese couple is like a slap in the face.  Of course it should come with white rice!  The food is edible, but I wouldn't rave about it .  I could make the same dishes at home for a fraction of the price. The previous review by Flippitti is right on.  It's certainly not worth the prices.  In fact, the size of the portions you are served make it a complete ripoff.  We had the chicken with string beans and the salt and pepper shrimp.  I am 5'1\" and 105 lbs. and could have eaten both orders by myself.  Needless to say, we left hungry and $36 poorer.  The salt and pepper shrimp is traditionally made with the shell still on and at some Chinese restaurants with the head on.  Their version (we assume to cater to American tastes) is made without the shells.  In order to accomplish this, they coat the shrimp with a dry, cardboard tasting flour mixture.  Then to disguise the fact that for $17, they are only serving you 8 small/medium size (not even large) shrimp, they pile them on top of a bed chopped green onions and cilantro.  By the way, the order of white rice that they so generously gave us with the entrees, was larger than the 2 entrees combined!  What was more amazing is that people kept coming in.  We couldn't understand it . Don't people get that they are paying out the nose for mediocre, pseudo Asian/Chinese food?

The business has a very cool atmosphere and we got to experience employee/customer appreciation day, which was awesome. Why the bad review then? Well, buying a new car from them is probably a safe bet, but we bought used. We bought a 2008 Ford Escape w/ 75k miles. Car drove great and Chris assured us it had a \"120 point inspection, was in tip top shape, and had service records to prove it\". I should've asked for the records. Upon further inspection a few days later though, i discovered the vehicle still had the original plugs and the gap was twice what it should've been. No biggie, $30 and it's done. Then while pulling the plugs I discovered the last spark plug well was filled, 1-2\", with oil! So the valve cover gasket was obviously shot as well. And the shocks/struts were also original, and should've been replaced at about 50k. I really didn't think I'd have to bring a tool set just to get a decent used vehicle from a respected dealership, guess I was wrong. So I attempted to contact the sales manager as well as the general manager via email...no response. All I was hoping for was for them to make things right and fix the gasket so I didn't have to. I would eat the cost of everything else. Apparently once you have bought one of their vehicles with a sham inspection though, they have no need to help you out any longer. So I thought, maybe their emails aren't working? So to test this, I emailed the same addresses but from my other email, inquiring about a vehicle... Got a response within a single day! How sad a Christian dealership deals with customers this way. So I spent about $300 and a few hours and replaced the stuff and all is well, vehicles is in tip top shape. Problem is I paid excellent KBB price from a dealership, plus all the other taxes and fees, when I could've just bought from craigslist if I wanted a vehicle that needed work, and I would've saved tons of $$. The vehicle was supposed to be in tip top shape when I bought it. Long story short...don't buy, especially used, from Cardinale Way Mazda Mesa. Nice enough people but they're basically buying vehicles from auction, giving them an oil change and a wash and calling it a \"120 point inspection\". Just another car dealer looking to make a quick $, and even worse, using a Christian label to do it...but without the Christian values. 2013-09-28 02:20:29 1.0\n",

The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland.

You'd think they'd take into consideration how much other apartments cost in this area and lower the rent. A lot more people would stay after their lease was up if rent wasn't so ridiculous.  Also, having to pay for parking at the place you live is unacceptable. Definitely feel like they're trying to make rent seem lower so they can trick people into living here. Have you seen this area?

With two people in line (me being #2), it took almost 20 mins to get this burger ready! Way too long. And they missed putting tomato had I not keep an eye on the assembly. Watching how they kept track of the order was funny. After it was wrapped up, they didn't know which burger was which so they had to unwrap it to check. OK common sense needs to prevail. Mark the dang thing after its wrapped! So disorganized it makes me wanna cry. Toppings are expensive when you add it together. Ohh the funny part is if you buy 100 burgers the next one is free!! Economically that's something like if you spend $700 you will get a freebie. How nice...Positives. The fries look good. Maybe I should have just ordered those instead. 2015-03-29 14:16:45 1.0\n",

The parking lot was dark and empty, and there was only one table about to leave as we entered the store. I guess it didn't help that it was raining that night. Anyhow, I was surprised at how dead this place was as the sign on the door said it closes at 11pm.

I took a look at the prices and they are honestly not all that cheap like what the other reviewers claimed, considering I've tried other places for about the same price and overall experience was much better. We ordered a steam pork and chives dumpling (14pcs) $5.99, fried onion pancake $2.99, beef noodle soup $6.99, and we wanted to try the Korean pork bone soup $7.99. The food came in decent time one after another. The beef noodle soup came in a pretty large bowl (could feed 2) but noodles had a very mild chlorine taste and soup was too merky for my liking, not to mention that there were only 5 small pieces of beef on top. Along came the Korean pork bone soup, and I must say I was pretty disappointed as I had pretty high hopes for this one. The price is the same as authentic Korean restaurants, so it wasn't cheap for something that was so flavourless, and presentation was just awful. Not to mention, we didn't get any Korean side dishes. The soup was not flavourful, the bean sprouts were literally all over the place making the dish super messy and the pork bones were not marinated through as it didn't have a strong spicy taste. Yes, they give you a lot of pieces of meat but it was just a huge mess, very hard to eat, and not authentic whatsoever. The dumplings came after and I hoped it was better but it did not taste good either. The meat had a very weird (rough) texture with a strange flavour. The onion pancake was probably the better of the dishes considering the price and the quantity.\n",

However, once my promotional deal ended I was paying double. I called and spoke to a very kind customer service representative, but she was unable to lower my bill because I was not a new customer. All of the promotions are for new customers only. Annoying. I canceled my service and switched providers which cut my bill in half. After paying what I thought was my last and final CenturyLink bill I received another bill! Disconnection fees. What a rip off! And I returned my rented equipment myself to the CenturyLink store. I called about disconnection fees as well. The only thing they could offer was that she would put a note on my account that I was never informed about the fee.

I have seen none so far this winter break, and since it is advertised as a student living apartment complex, then we are at high risk of break-ins during the holidays and school breaks.

Luckily I have personally secured it as best as I can and turned on my light to scare them off.

      "I have bought several sets of tires here, but on my last purchase they put a 3 to 4\" long and pretty deep scratch on all 4 of my factory Tacoma rims, right where they removed the weights. I showed the managers twice asking for them to have the paint repaired and they refused to do anything for me at all. The marks were blatantly theirs as the grudge from the previous weights were centered at each scratch, both managers even acknowledged that they did it. One even made the statement, \" What are we supposed to do? There is nothing that can be done for this.\" I told him that they needed to be refinished, his response? \"Never gonna happen\". So, yes we acknowledge that we damaged the rims, and no we aren't going to do anything to make it right. This was back in 2007, I haven't returned since.\n",
      "The scratches looked so bad I ended up buying another set of factory wheels that matched them, DISCOUNT TIRE WOULDN'T EVEN DO THE SWAP FOR ME!!!!! So I paid to have it done elsewhere, total cost was about a $300 hit all in and several hours of my time.\n",
      "I believe I have bought 7 or 8 sets of tires with Discount over the years for myself and probably 70 sets as a Fleet/Procurement Manager (at a different Discount Tire location). I have bought another 7 sets of tires since then at other places between my SUV, my project cars and my wife's car, and 3 sets of wheels, business they have lost along with countless tires at work since then (maybe 600 tires?) I even informed the other Discount Tire as to why they had lost my work business, more short sightedness, they also did nothing to help me, lol....\n",

The same thing happened at Big O Tire since then, at least Big O accepted fault and stepped up and repaired the rims.....\n",

One point of disappointment: The fresh-squeezed lemonade. Fresh-squeezed lemonade is very hard to find, least of all at a non-breakfast place, and because of that I specifically asked whether it was indeed freshly squeezed in-house (they said it was),  whether it was unsweetened (they said it was), and whether it was essentially lemon juice mixed with water (they said it was). Delighted, I ordered one. What arrived certainly didn't taste like fresh-squeezed lemonade. I asked again what was in it, because it tasted sweet to me, and they said it was fresh-squeezed lemonade with Country Time lemonade powder added to it (that's like ordering a glass of champagne and getting a champagne mixed with Sprite).

I had noticed an odor immediately upon being seated but said nothing because of the occasion. Well, after dinner I walked back through the opening in the rock wall to confirm my suspicion and indeed the restaurant's dumpsters are stored on the other side. I thought of saying something to the hostess at the time, but didn't.  Instead I took the time to write a letter, a real letter, to the owners alerting them to the problem. I wrote in the interest of the success of the restaurant, not seeking anything in return. What is most shocking about this experience is that I received no reply at all, not a thank you for alerting them, nor an apology. As far as the food goes, it was just OK. None of us, including especially our friend whose birthday it was and is from Georgia, was especially pleased with our menu choices. Needless to say we won't be returning anytime soon. 2016-06-16 17:22:33 1.0\n",

But I didn't think much of the food.  The cornbread, which we shared at the table, was weirdly bouncy, not the densely delicious Southern cornbread I was expecting.  The fried chicken entree came highly recommended by my server, but I found it overfried and undersalted.  It was very dark and intensely crunchy, but not delicious.  And it arrived sitting in a wet pool of collard greens.  The greens were tasty but the crispy chicken sitting and getting soggy in a pool of the liquor from the greens was weirdly unappetizing.  Maybe the fryer was too busy with fish fry (which was good, from the tastes I got from others at my table).  But I'm not really tempted to go back. 2016-06-30 02:23:12 1.0\n",

I'll repeat for emphasis: the pork had no bark!  For those uninitiated to the finer points of BBQ, bark is the tasty outer crust of rub on the outside of the meat. For pulled pork to have no bark means it had no flavor too. As for the sausage, it was tasty and very garlicky. I did not catch a flavor of jalapeño Or cheddar, but it was tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the pork ribs, they were big a meaty. Unfortunately, they too suffered from a lack of bark. A bit dry, but better than the pulled pork. They did have a nice smoked pepper flavor (chipotle or ancho maybe), but that was the only interesting note. The sliced brisket was at best mediocre for similar reasons as the prior reviewed meats. The burnt ends were nice and fatty, with more bark than any other meat we had. At a none BBQ restaurant, I would have considered them good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we've covered the meats, I'll keep the sides and fixings quick. The rolls were simple dinner yeast rolls, they did not have the light crumb or high fat content of a brioche (as advertised on the menu). The pickles, onions, and slaw were fine. All on par with the quality a friend who just got into cooking.\n",

      "We tried the Mac n Cheese and the corn bread. The  former had too thin a sauce for the noodle type, and did not hold flavor.

The pork was of good quality but pretty flavorless. No bark or burnt ends. They have 3 sauces you can add, all were OK, not great, but you shouldn't have to. The jalapeno cheddar sausage tasted like neither jalapeno nor cheddar. It wasn't unpleasant but odd and with a very grainy not meaty texture. The corn bread was quite good. As others have stated, too many staff who kept trying to remove our plates before we were done. For a BBQ place at this price point with this kind of foodie pedigree it was quite a disappointment.

However, I didn't hear him say the name, but my friends did which is why when he asked who ordered it they didn't point it to my direction. When I pointed out it was the wrong burger, the waiter questioned if I was sure I ordered the correct burger.

Cute hanging lights over the booths are illuminated with awful \"environmentally friendly\" bulbs that are so bright it is almost painful to look at the person across from you.  Similar lights in the bar area appear to use old fashioned filament bulbs which are much more appropriate.  The lighting over the booths is so awful we had to ask for them to be dimmed which they did for about five minutes before turning them up again to full capacity!  It really makes for an unpleasant dining experience.  In addition, the wait staff could use some additional training.  Often water glasses are left unfilled.  During two of our meals our waitress changed during the meal and the new waitress got our orders incorrect.  Also, it doesn't appear to be the cleanest of establishments.  Hopefully, with the food on track, the manager can focus on the smaller details which can truly make or break a dining experience.  At this point, I will be taking a long break from Smoking' Q's. 2017-08-03 15:28:08 1.0\n",

This has nothing to do with his office and everything to do with the labor and delivery team/my recent experience with them. Yesterday I was admitted to the hospital for several issues including abdominal pain, contractions, head ache, leaking, back ache/body aches, and nausea. I was told that my urine looked fine but they still wanted to give me an IV and have me drink lots of water. The nurse who provided the IV was extremely aggressive and hurt me in the process of doing it. I've been to this location multiple times and have never felt that much pain from an IV stick. I even told her my right arm is where they usually do it because it's easier but she said my veins looked fine on my left so continued with the left because it was more convenient for her. She didn't want to move the station to the other side and then blamed me for my vein getting lost while she was hurting me with the needle fiddling around inside trying to find the vein. Then gave me attitude the entire time. The other nurse who has longer hair was an absolute doll and was really sweet to me, made me feel comfortable. But both nurses failed to get me the nurse call button and I was not searching around the room for it so I had to undo my own hook up to be able to get up and use the restroom. When I went to do so and notified them, the rude nurse who did my IV pointed at the restroom door like I was stupid and didn't apologize for not being there to help. I never want to work with this nurse again as my c section is suppose to be at this hospital. She was apart of the night shift as there were only two once the earlier shift left. Not only have my symptoms continued after the experience. I didn't get my baby checked by ultrasound following my multiple concerns. Just because my dilation hasn't changed doesn't mean a mothers intuition isn't right.

Our waitress also served as bartender so service tended to be on the slow side.  We started off with a carafe of red sangria ($10) and a chicken empanada (3 Stars, $3) served with what tasted like mustard spiked mayonnaise.

Meanwhile we kept working on the Sangria while enjoying the bar scene.  It was at this point that we decided we were not going to be in the mood for a full meal so we asked the waitress/bartender if we could use the Restaurant.com certificate for the Sangria and appetizers.  Not a problem said my now much more efficient waitress. As the bewitching hour of 7PM approached we quickly requested the Serrano ham and tomato bread tapas. (0.5 Stars, $3)  I did a quick calculation using the Dewey Decimal System and determined we were going to have a difficult time reaching the $35 minimum required for use of the Restaurant.com certificate so we ordered the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce tapas (5 Stars, $7).  We were now satiated and ready to quit, but we ordered 2 mini desserts, coconut bread pudding with sorbet and a truffle chocolate cake (2.5 Stars, $4).

Perhaps \"shmeed\" might be a better word... can anyone help me?)  The ff. is the closest image I found to what I think I had.  (If so, then my dessert was missing the ashtar topping, a type of clotted cream, pictured below.)  The dessert I bought doesn't even come close to approaching the wow factor of this link's image...

I wish I had kept driving.  I am a big fan of tortas, however, and could not resist temptation.  I ordered the torta de aguacate, which is basically an avacado sandwich with mayo/crema.  There are jalapenos and a tomato on it as well. No lettuce.  The bulk of the taste is the mayo/crema, which was so overpowering that I could not finish my meal.  I ordered to go, so I tried to mask the taste at home, adding various ingredients in attempt to improve the flavor by killing the crema.  Morningstar chicken and delicious New Mexican salsa could not save the sandwich unfortunately.  \n",

      " HqkEW23C994c9O7T-_IfXg The \"new & improved\" Iowa Cafe leaves a lot to be desired.  The restaurant has moved from it's former location into an old vacant fast food drive-thru establishment (I believe it used to be an Arby's).  My husband and I have been on & off again customers over the years and have never had any major complaints about the wait times, food or service levels. After driving through the area a few weeks back, we noticed the new signage, \"Iowa Cafe,\" and we're both thinking, \"Cool, they're moving\" and we were excited to come back.  Well, with much disappointment I must say, our experience was sub-par at best, which is NOT at all what we were expecting.  We arrived, placed our name on the waiting list, which in all we maybe waited 10 mins (if that), so that was a thumbs up.  Then we were seated at a 2-top by the exit door, which looked like the space would best serve a newspaper rack and a couple of gum ball machines, rather than a spot to enjoy a meal (thumbs down).  We were seated by the owner and quickly greeted by the waitress who filled our drink order (2 coffees).  When she returned, we quickly ordered; my husband a 2 meat omelet and I ordered 1 pancake, 2 sausage links with 1 scrambled egg, nothing too complicated, right?  Wrong!  After finishing up our 2nd cup of coffee having waited over 20 minutes we began to wonder where our food was, just then an older couple was seated across from us in an equally poor spot.  (On a side note, when we were seated a young couple with a baby in a highchair were sitting in this spot, when the owner came by and moved them to another table stating that it is a fire hazard to seat anyone there). About 15 minutes later, the couple who was sat across from us received their food.  The older man quickly said, \"Have you folks received your food yet?\"  We smiled and politely said, \"no, not yet.\"  Then he said, \" you know we've been going to the Iowa cafe for over 30 years!\"  And after a few minutes of chit-chat, we settled back into our tables.  Now, finishing our 4th cup of coffee, our wait time had surged to over 40 minutes.  We had a vet appointment for our dog at 1:45pm, it was now 1:05pm, not able to wait any longer and seeing no signs of our food, watching table after table receiving theirs, we finally flagged down our waitress and said, \"we never received our food, we've been waiting 45 mins!\"  The waitress looked shocked (however, keep in mind she was filling our coffee cups the whole time and serving others around us whom she helped AFTER us)..  The waitress did do the right thing, she comped our coffees and didn't charge us for the food we never received.  At that point, we up and left even more hungry than we had come, but now had nothing in our tummies to offset our extreme coffee buzz.  This may have been an oversight, but having said nothing is worse than keeping us informed or admitting a mistake was made.  We will not be back. 2012-01-03 02:46:27 1.0\n",

The technician was drinking from an open fast food cup while doing my nails and snacking right next to me as my nails dried- not a very hygienic practice. My \"citrus manicure\" was actually a really fast basic manicure with some incredibly strong smelling off brand fruity lotion at the end. I specifically scheduled the citrus because the other manicure option had strong smelling oils and I wanted to avoid that.  The high table and stool were uncomfortable for a manicure, so following my massage I'm sitting there perched on a stool, crammed into a cold corner with my shoulders hunched up around my ears and an overwhelming smell making my head hurt.

      " aqamI4tRJBjHF4sRWMDBbg Stopped in to buy 3 dozen doughnuts for my son's birthday party at school. Everything was fine until I asked for a stack of napkins. One of guys said they couldn't do that because of some bs story about how it cuts into profits and all the doughnuts they sold in a day. I was welcome to pull 36 napkins one at a tine from the dispenser but they wouldn't give it to me in a stack. Really? I just spent over $30 in doughnuts but you won't  give me a stack of napkins? One for each doughnut. What's going to eat into your profits is the fact that I won't ever come here again and I'll not recommend this shop to anyone. Ever. Customer service; it's a thing and a happy customer is well worth a stack of napkins. 2015-04-20 21:42:14 1.0\n",

The ingredients seemed pretty fresh, but kinda reminded me of trying to make pizza at home that just tastes completely \"off\" from any of your favorite pizza places.  I get that this is a Chicago place, but even still, I've had Chicago-style that I thought was much better from other spots.

Their sauce is hard to describe, but I do tend to agree with others that say it tastes a little like Campbell's tomato soup. I threw out most of my order tonight (pizza and chicken parm), it just wasn't for me. I feel like these folks do achieve a decent level of quality, but whether or not you like the recipes - you'll have to decide for yourself. Prices are too high for what you get.

      " zMf4u1V761A4tiqHEvdgWQ I had a great time at the Yelp Elite event Wednesday night, however, my experience at the bar prior to the event-and I truly feel bad for saying this since the event was amazing-involved some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I know Jake said he reads yelp reviews, which is why I'm writing this so he can take note of my personal experience and hopefully correct this so no one else has the same experience. Even my mom, who came with me to the event, said she felt bad for how I was being ignored repeatedly in favor of guests who came up to the bar long after me to order drinks. Basically, I walked up to the bar with money in hand, was looking at the beer list briefly, and quickly determined what I wanted. One particular bar tender (I'm choosing not to physically describe him but would be happy to if asked) made eye contact with me multiple times and never asked if I needed anything BUT asked the guys sitting next to where I was standing at the bar if they needed anything, then he walked right by me to a couple that JUST walked up to the bar when I had been standing there for AT LEAST 5-7 minutes not being served. He was more than friendly with them! This bartender was even doing a little cleaning behind the bar rather than coming to see if I needed anything as a (trying to be) paying customer! There was another bar tender who also never asked if I needed anything (meanwhile, I'm standing with the beer list in hand), but since he momentarily paused in front of me, I said (and after waiting 10 minutes, yes, I was a bit frustrated), \"Can I get a couple of drinks when someone gets a chance?\" I worked in the service industry previously for 10 years and I have learned to treat EVERYONE equally. I feel that I was being ignored, for whatever reason I'm not sure. Coincidentally, when my mom went up to the bar herself to get a drink prior to the event, both bartenders IMMEDIATELY came over to her. It just makes me wonder. ....... Good thing this was a Yelp event because if this was my only interaction/experience at this Voodoo location, I guarantee I would not be back, regardless of good beer or not. 2015-07-10 15:42:19 1.0\n",

There appeared to be a lot of Horsing around, kidding around, and not much waiting on the customers.  Had to ask for silverware for our table.

Had to flag down the waitress multiple times to get a refill on our drinks. The big disappointment though was the loose meat sandwich it was so dry that it was almost not edible and in fact my husband and I both left half of it.

Today was the first worst service that my friend and I have received. Maybe the girl/hostess didn't intentionally try to give me and attitude, but I feel like there's a certain way to greet and speak to people when they enter a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, I arrived before my friend got there. Since My Parents and I have always went there to eat breakfast, I talked up the place; saying it was one of the best places to have brunch. I got excited for him to try the food (since he's always down to try new hole-in-the-wall restaurants. He took an Uber from Tempe to this location; I told him he would not be sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when I arrived, the hostess/waitress with a good sized tattoo on her arm didn't really greet me. Only said \"One of you?\" I responded with \"Yeah, and there will be another person arriving.\" She said \"Okay\" and walked away. I saw a few empty tables and wondered if I should have sat myself down, but I really didn't want to disregard the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. So I kept my eyes on her to see if she would wave me over. \n",
      "\n",
      "She continued to assist customers that we already seated and I really didn't mind waiting. I just wished she would have said \"Please wait a minute\" or \"I'll seat you in just a second.\" Then I wouldn't be left waiting or disappointed (I hate being brushed off). So I waited, watching her run herself around the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went back behind the counter and then walked out and rudely walked across in front of me with no \"Excuse me.\" If we were vehicles and she ran a red light, I would have T-boned her. She was that close to me reaching for menus next to the counter that I was standing next to. I shook my head at her like \"Geez. I could have moved if you said 'Excuse me.'\" \n",
      "\n",
      "So she grabbed the menus and walked to a table booth area without saying anything. So I stood there watching her put the menus on the table, with her looking back at me like 'Duh, follow me.' At this point, I'm wondering if it's that hard to politely ask the customer to follow you to the next available table? I sat down with her saying nothing to me of course. \n",
      "\n",
      "I knew right then that if she was in fact going to be my waitress, I would request another one. So while I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I drank my first beverage brought by another waitress which I hoped would be better, but it seemed like she was being very forgetful. She forgot/lost the ticket that belong to the couple that were seated next to me. Then, I didn't pay it no mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my friend arrived, we looked over the menu, and then our waitress arrived. She took down our beverages (including my second beverage) and order, we chatted for a good while until we both noticed that we never received our beverages. We would have flagged her down but she never came around our area until she brought our meals, including our missing beverages. It's not too big of a deal. We just noticed that we never got our beverages while we waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food was good as always; my friend would agree. He didn't experience the rudeness upon my arrival, which is good because, he'd probably would never want to return if he got there before me. \n",

First off ( in my best Donald Trump voice) the portions were YUGE!!. Sadly the eggs Benedict was a flavorless mess. It was not played well, just kind of slopped all over the plate with a watery absolutely flavorless yellow something I would not even recognize as hollandaise sauce on top. The biscuit gravy was delicious but when brought out had that not so nice under the  heat lamp  too long crust on it. Had our server ever come back around to say, refill our coffee, or ask about our food I would have returned it. The biscuits were obviously store bought mush. My wife's only response was meh.

When our order finally arrived, everything was correct, but we were all so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point.

Approx 10 sets of tires over 15 years.  Today, their demeanor and professionalism sucked.  I was informed the exact same tires that I previously had on my car that lasted 49K miles, are currently at their last possible rotation after less than 25K miles. I got no explanation, other than, \"yea, you'll need to replace them soon.\"  Next, as I hand the guy my keys, he says it will be two hours to rotate my tires.  If you told me this up front, you could have saved us both some time.  Don't assume your customers have 2 hours to spare for tire rotation, it isn't logical.  If it will take more than an hour, just tell us up front and we'll stop by when you aren't so busy.  At the end, I'm waiting for my car to be pulled out of the garage.  While I'm sure the loud Rap music is fun for guys working on cars it just annoys me.  Next, the guy pulling out my car drives right past me standing 5 feet from him, and parks at the far end of the lot.  So, I wait for him to get back inside the building, where it's just me and two employees.  One guy is bitching about how an employee failed to get the make and model of a car on his paperwork, and what an idiot he is.  Guess what?   I don't give a sh*t about your internal dirty laundry!  Keep that sh*t to yourself when customers are in the building!  What happened to your professionalism?  Or was it just because Joe wasn't working today?  Anyway,  the cherry on top of this shitty experience, was as I drove off the lot I had to pull over because they didn't close the hood. Appears you have managed to let greed replace your previous business model of customer service and integrity.  Now you are the same as every other tire shop...    What's next?

Picture looks big but it wasn't bigger than half my hand balled up) Then she had the nerve to charge us a dollar for it!!! Oh, and it was burnt. Tasted like pure charcoal. Really ridiculous.

Seriously it is head & shoulders above buffet sushi pretty much anywhere I've ever been aside from perhaps RuSan's (in Atlanta, have never tried RuSan's in Charlotte but I hear they also do sushi buffet lunch). They also have a really big (and separate from the sushi thank God) hibachi build it yourself grill. The actual \"regular\" buffet itself is like 3x bigger than anywhere else. The food is always fresh and turning over because this place is always busy. We went here right before closing one night and it was still packed. Nothing but fresh. It's clean for a buffet, I don't feel sketched out about the quality or origin of what they serve like some places. It is also blessedly not full of MSG. I couldn't eat here if it was. They always have a huge variety of stuff. My husband and I live 45 minutes away but we still would rather go here than anywhere near us because those places suck so much and cost the same or more, we don't want to be disappointed.

No worries, since I wanted to ask my usual questions re food allergies.  Told lone female barista it was my first time here and asked if there were more food offerings besides what I saw in the dessert case, and she said yes and said there were more on menus as she pointed to the small menu sheets next to the cash register.  My eyes gravitated to another mini-blackboard menu titled Seasonal items, and I  instantly wanted to know more about the \"Dreamsicle- Mango Cheesecake\" selection.  I added that I'd like to hear more about these seasonal items, especially that Mango Cheesecake, and she told me \"Oh, they're just something we do here... We serve other items that you find in other coffee shops...\"  Hmm...  She didn't seem enthusiastic about them.  I was still curious about what mango cheesecake coffee would taste like, so I asked her what goes into the drink to make it taste like the dessert, to which she responded that the flavors come from the syrups they use... And I looked towards where she turned her head to, and I saw a wall of Torani syrups.  No gusto, no enthusiasm regarding this delicious-sounding drink, so I stopped considering to get one, told her I was waiting for a friend, and took a food menu to read at a table nearby.  I went back after a few minutes of studying the menu to ask about the breads used for their \"Sourdough Toast & Jam\" and the Copper State sandwich.  Both are made with sourdough bread from a shop \"that starts with an \"M,\" so I volunteered \"MJ?,\" and she said \"yes!\"  Volstead (or is it The Nile now, since the coffee cups have \"The Nile\" printed on them) uses two types of MJ bread- sourdough and multi-grain, and while she didn't have ingredients lists, she thought that the sourdough wouldn't contain any corn in it.  (Allergy.)  The barista also checked and told me that the boysenberry jam did not contain cornstarch.  I sat back down again, and as I waited for friend to arrive, I checked-in on Yelp.\n",

Paid for my order and stepped aside for friend to put in her order.  She asked the barista about the Mango Cheesecake, and the barista gushed about how she loves to craft these drinks on the seasonal menu and that coworkers actually would tease about how she enjoyed making them.  WTH?  Why tell me one thing and feign no interest in the drinks and then speak and act another way to someone else?

This is consistent with any appointment made after the first appointment in the morning. It would not be bad, if they would call and let you know before you sit there for that long, but this is not the case. I see Dr. Wolfe who is brilliant and really cares for her patients, but the other things are just concerning. I had a prescription for a new glucose meter with new strips. I assumed it was called in, since they went out of the way to find out who was my pharmacy. Then I never got a call from the pharmacy. I checked the pharmacy nothing called in. Called the office. Got the run around. FINALLY was able to get the glucose meter called in. NO STRIPS. After 2 more calls I was able to get that ordered. Should not be this difficult. I asked for a change in metformin, again Dr. Wolfe took all the notes and told me it would be done. Still has not changed. I am at the point I will look for another doctor.

We ordered a lobster roll and poke bowl and were given a playing card as a number (which seemed to be very confusing for the food runners - they had to come close to every table just to see the specific card). We waited...we waited some more...people came, ate, and left and we still were not fed. After 45 minutes of becoming increasingly hungry and impatient I asked the female food-runner to confirm that our food was coming. She looked very flustered and said \"I'll check hold on...I don't get paid enough for this\". She checked and let us know she told the manager as she continued to bustle around complaining to different diners about how little she was being paid which was odd. After another 10-15 minutes the manager came over and let us know that the ticket didn't make it to the kitchen for whatever reason and kept saying he had no idea what happened (assuring...a manager who has no idea what happened or how to handle it). After another few minutes he put the food in front of us and instead of offering a concession or making any real effort to mitigate our inconvenience he said \"here's a cookie to smooth you over\" and walked away. \"To smooth you over\"...really? Maybe I am a little more conscious of customer service and hospitality having worked in hospitality and property management, but I was pretty shocked. \n",

He said they were so dangerous that he refused to put any air into them.  So she told him she would have me check them.  Well, that guy was BSing her and trying to scare her.  Her tires still had about 1/4 inch of tread on them.  Depending upon what source you use, tires need to be replaced when tire treads get to about 1/8 to 1/16 inch left.  My wife's tires were nowhere close to being dangerously low and did not need replacement at this time.  These types of car guys who try to take advantage of women are bad news!

I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars. 2009-07-17 05:10:25 1.0\n",

I thought it would taste spectacular since they specialize in just poutines, but quite frankly new York fries is probable better.  The only difference is they have a wide range of toppings such as AAA beef, chicken, pork and a few more ordinary mix-ups that you wouldn't normally add to your fries.  They use a typical beef gravy, much like something that you could whip up at home yourself.  The poutine left a sour after taste, my friend suspected that it was red wine.  I was curious to find out what it was so I asked the cashier.  I brought the poutine up to the counter and saw the look on her face, she was probably hoping that I wouldn't complain. She said the sour after taste came from the south western sauce marinaded with the pork.  \n",

We received an email telling us of a close location (Whole Foods, Scottsdale) that we could experience the things we have come to enjoy and love. Quick, gourmet plates of saucy goodness with just the right amount of spice and flavor that would make us talk about the trucks for weeks, counting the days until they rolled onto that welcoming asphalt off Raintree Drive again. Being a lover of the tastes and smells of New Orleans, I opted to try Jamburritos Cajun Grille Express. Note now that the temperature was 106, high noon, standing on black asphalt. \n",

Many of us waited over 30 minutes to get our food, some people just getting a simple Chicken K-Taco plate. As I waited, to my horror, I saw a prepackaged frozen bag of hush puppies heading to some vat. Maybe they have a hush-puppy machine at home? I was expecting hand rolled pup's like mom used to make. Instead, over fried golf balls. By the time I got my The Jambirrito, it was soft, oozy and a little cold. The flavors that I expected to explode my senses tasted like they took a little McCormick Cajun Seasoning and kicked it up a bit with some cayenne pepper. I really wasn't tasting anything that I would associate with jambalaya, and thought the chicken may have been a little undercooked. The cheese was simple melted pepper jack, and the lettuce wilted. Waiting in the hot Arizona sun for 30 minutes only added to the disaster we called lunch. Had it been the best damn meal I had all week, I would have instantly forgotten the wait.  I give Jamburrito's 3 stars for trying something new and being on the forefront of the Phoenix Food Truck scene, but am giving them a single star for efficiency and taste. 2011-08-18 21:49:11 1.0\n",

      " iQNsOSMPE9l31RPpnZSUjw TNT formerly Peoria Crossing, still provides the same abysmal wash services.  Mosh pit crew routinely use dirty rags, forget to vacuum trunks, miss door jambs, do not apply dressing to tires, dash, etc when paid,  do not shake out mats, leave dirt and oil on lower parts of rocker panels that the brushes miss, and generally have to be asked to provide the services for which one paid. Management is almost non-existent, and when a supervisor is found, show complete disinterest in problem resolution beyond hollering at the nearest guy with a rag and pointing at a spot.  Services are overpriced.  Detail services are marginally better.  Had a van, a sedan, and a BMW convertible detailed there over the years, each time after an ownership change.  At least once a vehicle was not buffed as agreed upon and paid for, and another time a vehicle was not hand waxed.  Management sheepishly admitted to \"saving time\" and apologized.\n",

There's nothing more satisfying than deep fried potatoes smothered in cheese and dark brown deliciousness, but I left the Big Cheese feeling like crap.

In my defense, I didn't know they were going to add the gravy to it. For some reason I was imagining it was going to be similar to The Works from New York Fries, but it was so far from it.

Dash still had dust, interior door panels not wiped down and the cup holders hadn't been touched. I had already tipped the employee who had cleaned and he went on to another car. I asked another employee if they had a clean rag so I could wipe down the interior. As I'm doing this the Manager, a younger white guy with a buzz cut comes to me and says I have to: \"get my car out of there\". I told him they didn't wipe down the inside of the car and he gives me this dirty pissed off look, closes my door and just walks off.  Won't be back a third time, too many other choices out there.

Not a huge difference and still a good deal; but it becomes a bigger issue when you find this out after placing an order for the office and, upon arriving to pick it up, the price is on average $2 more per person. Reading previous reviews seems to show I'm not the only one who has had issues with the prices listed on their website not being honored when you actually go to pay.

Now I love my dogs but I'm not rich so $150 is not easy spending money and I don't have credit cards I can just let $150 hang out with interest on. She let it slide and gave me a $20 ear flush to try out and when I returned in February she ONCE AGAIN pushed the $150 ear mites test on me. Now I know Luna's ears have a lot of wax in them but I had a feeling in my gut that ear mites was not at all the problem.

I already had a less than positive experience from another animal hospital in Henderson weeks prior. They tried to upsell me and tell me all the problems my dog had without even properly examining him. I was warned by the NSPCA about vets like this, so I decided to go to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital as a friend had referred me. \n",
      "Upon arrival, the staff was just as friendly as they were on the phone. They got my dog all set up in their system, and we patiently waited for the doctor. This is where the problems began. Dr. Starks was horribly rude and condescending. He walked in and looked as if he was annoyed he had to take a 6:30pm appointment. He cut me off every single time I tried to speak, and corrected me and made me feel as if I was stupid. When explaining the situation to him, the only thing he heard was that I had recently adopted my dog. He immediately started to imply that my dog had certain illnesses from the shelter, such as kennel cough. This was exactly what the NSPCA warned me about, I thought. I advised him that I had already seen another vet and he was fine, but to focus on the issue at hand. He began to tell me that my dog probably had some sort of infection and that he would need to take him in the back. I told him that I needed to know how much any procedures would be, and he immediately got defensive and said that \"we will obviously give you an estimate,\" rolled his eyes, and took my dog in the back. \n",
      "Literally two minutes later, a staff member walked in with a printed paper of all the recommended procedures, prescriptions, and prices upwards of almost $400. I, as a diligent and smart individual, started to question every charge. If I'm going to pay for something, I'd like to know what I'm getting. Isn't that pretty standard? Well, not here. She started getting annoyed because I asked questions. The staff member insinuated that it was because I couldn't afford the procedures, which was not the case. I only wanted to know that if there was anything else I could do, such as home remedies or over the counter medicines, that I would rather do that. Instead, I felt bullied into paying them the high prices. When she couldn't take it anymore, she told me that she would get the doctor, and left. A few minutes later, I heard the doctor talking about me outside of the door, and then he literally barged in, rolled his eyes once again, and said \"So you had questions?\" His attitude was far beyond professional, and I had had enough. I told him of course I had questions as people should, and that I didn't understand how he could take my dog in the back and less than two minutes later have a printed paper with estimates. I didn't realize infections were diagnosed so quickly. It would have taken at least two minutes to type and print out that paper. Did you even have time to examine him? The more questions I asked, the angrier and shorter with me he got. He never once closed the door and argued with me in the doorway.

When I talked to Jennifer I clearly explained the importance of getting all paperwork and everything in order prior to us bringing our dogs there for the stay. I even stopped by the office and talked to Jennifer and gave her a copy of the current shot records for each of our dogs. I explained to Jennifer that one of our dogs needed her shots updated. I asked her if I needed to bring that dog to their clinic early to get her shots and anything else you may need updated prior to us leaving on our trip. We had a very early flight and I explained to her that we needed to simply drop the dogs off and get out of there as quickly as possible in order to meet our flight time. She assured me that she would get all the records from Craig animal hospital and that it would be no problem checking the dogs in quickly and getting out in order to get to the airport on time. When we arrived on the day of our flight the staff there wanted us to wait around in order for a vet to examine one of our dogs because the shots weren't updated. I explained what Jennifer had told me and also of my offer to come in days prior to get this taken care of and they told me they had no idea. Eventually after me strenuously explain this to them they agreed to get the records from Craig animal hospital and give The one dog who needed an updated shot her shot and that we would take care of this when we came back from our trip. When we came back from our trip we noticed several billing errors one they charge for physical exams on two dogs that were already done at the Criag clinic they also gave a dog a rabies shot he did not need  which once again was taking care of at the Craig clinic apparently no one at lone Mountain called over to Craig or there was a miscommunicationand we ended up paying extra money for services we did not need. Jennifer was there when we were picking our dogs up and assured me that she would call Craig clinic get the records and refund my credit card for the overcharges. That was over one month ago.

The waitress suggested that we get something else to ensure that there was enough food, so we ordered the chicken from the Chinese-Korean section ($16).  Finally, we ordered soju to go with our meal ($12), at the suggestion of my other friend, who's been to S. Korea.  Every one of these items, without exception, was subpar.  The pork belly, normally one of my favorite items to order, was chewy and flavorless, indicating low quality meat and overcooking.  The chicken was something straight out of an Americanized Chinese take-out place, consisting of fried and breaded pieces smothered in a thick, sweet sauce with some vegetables sprinkled in for good measure.  Some of the chicken pieces were almost completely dry, whereas others were gooey from sitting in the sauce, making for an inconsistent and undesirable texture.  The soju was sweetish and watery, despite being straight from the bottle.\n",

Indeed, we had to ask the person who came to bus our table for the check.

So we had told her probably the latter as we were expecting more people. Then she said after sighing \"OK... Good to know.\" First of all, if you're not mentally prepared to wait on two tables for a group, then either trade with someone or ask for help, but don't give your customers that type of attitude.

Here's the shady part: she added service charge to every single bill. This was only noticed later on when we had already paid our bills.

There was one person finishing up at the register (he only got a regular coffee), a group of three, and then me. That makes it 20 minutes, to make 4 drinks. So the line at the drive through is long, the wait inside is long, even with 5 people working? Something was amiss here... and I know what it is. I am ALL about fun at work, but when the lines are long and people are waiting, it's time to buckle down and handle business. All hands on a focused deck! I also noticed there was not much multitasking going on, making one drink at a time type thing. So if you can't multitask well, and you're playing around, that means people are going to be late getting back to work from their break (this girl).

      " fL3-ep_fUnDXv8BMmtMbnQ I came in with a few friends and we were really excited to try their sandwiches based on all of the positive reviews. I've had many bahn mi in my day and I'd consider this experience one of my least favorite. Upon entering, you form a line and are surrounded by prepared snacks, meals and drinks. Everything looks great, but is a little pricey. I decided against a prepared meal as most of the reviews were for their sandwiches. I opted for the Saigon sandwich 10\" which cost $3.75. It's on special and all of the other 10\" sandwiches are $4.25. The Saigon has pate, Vietnamese sausage and ham with the radish/carrot slaw and cilantro. After purchasing our food we sat outside to enjoy our meals. There is no covering when you sit in their outdoor area so be cautious on sunny days as it can get a little hot. My first bite into the sandwich was all bread. This wouldn't have been so terrible if the bread wasn't hard and dry. Usually when I eat bahn mi the bread is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, but this bread was hard and dry out the outside with an inside to match. Needless to say, I ate the sandwich open faced style as the bread tore up the roof of my mouth. Overall the downfall of this place is the following: 1) the bread to meat ratio is off. There's more than double the bread and it's terrible bread. 2) the atmosphere. It's like eating inside a convenience store. 3) The service. You never enjoy coming to a place where you feel like you're inconveniencing the staff. 2016-07-05 11:41:07 1.0\n",

I was told it would be done in about an hour. I walked over to one of the many fast food places and had a bite to eat. I returned back to the shop about 1115 and my vehicle was still in the parking lot. So I waited and waited. At 1145 I asked how much longer my vehicle would before it would get the oil change?  I was told that they were going to to it right away that they were busy and lost track of time. When asked how long it was going to take I was told 30-45 minutes more to complete.  I was unable to wait that long, so I retrieved my keys and left.

      " fjcPAB3bbj7ya79zOA9SFQ My husband made this reservation. The hotel was under construction which didn't bother me too much except the fitness room wasn't available. But not a big deal. The room was really nice and clean. Had an issue with the AC vent in the actual room. It wasn't blowing into the room. We just adjusted the temperature to the lowest possible setting so that it eventually cooled the room. Breakfast was very good. The staff at the restaurant was very nice and friendly. Here's why I am giving it two stars. My husband had a meeting but before leaving asked if I could have a late check-out. The staff said that it was fine, and I was to check out at 1pm. Around 11:30 a.m. someone called my room I tried to answer but whoever was calling  hung up after one ring and when I finally caught the phone they hung up in my ear.  A few minutes later someone knocked on my door and rattled the door handle, I screamed from the inside of the room that someone was still in the room. I did this about three times. But the person insisted and finally opened my door. I wasnt fully dressed and there was a privacy sign on the door. Plus my husband arranged late check out, so I am not sure why someone would try to get into my room! It was a man, and when I screamed hard enough he closed the door. I couldn't even run to the door to keep it closed because I wasn't dressed! I called the front desk and they told me that it was probably the engineer trying to fix the phone. Why would he even be messing with rooms that were occupied, I had a privacy sign on the door and worse of all, I was screaming from inside to not open door! Ugh I was so mad! I called my husband and he got with the front desk to recount what happened. Apologies were given but they didn't even try to make the situation better or compensate me.

      "Service (1/5): 1 of the 2 main reasons why I wouldn't come back. I knew we had to wait \"longer\" than usual, but good service would have warned us that we'd have to wait around 1 hour for food... We waited 50 minutes for pizza, 55 minutes for poutine.

How the crust was great and overall for a mom and pop shop they did make good pizza... but that won't make up for the food poisoning my boyfriend and I paid for after the fact. We both thought it was something else, but after I brought home left overs for my family they also had to use the bathroom to get rid of what they ate. I figure it was because Pino's was understaffed and with an influx of orders they rushed and did not cook the pizza well enough. The Poutine was pretty standard, nothing much to say there. \n",

While the hotel is nice and people are friendly my point of view is based on the fact that a simple situation happened that shouldn't have occurred. It's all about house keeping. For some reason they decided to ignore our room if we chose to have breakfast at 10:00. This happened 2 days in a row. So yes a do not disturb sign was out till then. The hotel read that as an all day sign. When we would return to our room at 6:00 pm our room still didn't have housekeeping service. While this may not be a big deal for some it is not something we were used to in this type of hotel. We wanted to return to our room for a rest with no thought which is the point of a vacation. Me and my wife aren't divas so if that is their way of operating just let us know up front and we will pick another place. They did try to appease use but it was with 2 $10 drink tickets. Each drink we are willing to pay for cost $18 so we owed money on that. The other remedy was points attached to the hotel...SERIOUSLY?? 2018-04-27 02:36:12 1.0\n",

(Side note: it doesn't take much for it to be very busy because the place is way too small) Either way I came in to hunt for a low chair for my fiancé because he can't sit at the high tops or stand for long. I saw a table in the far corner that only had one chair and wasn't being used. My fiancé sat down and we were approached by a server and told they were on a wait. I explain my fiancé's knee, we weren't trying to cut the line but it was obvious that this table wasn't being used since they didn't have enough chairs to go around. We were treated quiet rudely. No one every returned to our table to put us on the wait, I approached the counter and said we can just place a togo order since my fiancé can't stand and y'all are on a wait.

We ordered our poke bowls as well and then next thing you know our bowls are on the table without or oyster app. I asked if he had forgotten to ring it in and they said oysters take a long time to prepare. (Mhm really? Shucking 8 oysters doesn't take long but ok) My fiancés bowl was wrong, it was suppose to be half portions of two fishes and it wasn't plus a few ingredients left off. Then a few minutes later we were basically done with our dinner and the app of oysters shows up. The, what I believe was the manager, sat them down and walked off. She didn't tell me which oysters were which or tell me about the sauces or anything. Eventually our server comes back and we ask him. He didn't know either and had to go ask. Then I said \"I don't see any horseradish, May I please have some?\" The server points at a ramekin of ice \"it's right there\" like I am stupid or something.

I purchased a mini detail which is interior and exterior cleaning, and something else that was listed was \"upholstery/leather treatment\". I would have thought this meant the seats, but apparently it didn't, it meant the dashboard and the display console area (steering wheel also) pretty much the dashboard the of car. My feedback to the owner is this can be a little deceptive because upholstery and leather treatment sounds like the seats. So none of my seats were clean and the door also had some oily fingerprints on it, they didn't clean the door. This was ok because I told them and they did an awesome job of cleaning. A couple other things is nobody seemed like they were on the same page, I asked the lady in side what the leather treatment meant and she said \"I don't know, ask the guy out there\" then I asked if there was a menu for a description and she said no. I really feel like some description for the services would be helpful to customers. Again to the owner - bump up your review status! If your customers aren't happy, make up for it!

I absolutely love the other locations so I was excited to check out the DT location after the game. The reason I am giving this review is due to the service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was just leaning over the edge of the bar not even paying attention to us. After awhile, I had to flag him down to get his attention. He did let us sample a few beers after I asked, but he didn't seem to like his job as he wasn't very engaging. We ordered our drinks and didn't hear from him after that. We were trying to close our tab and asked the female bartender if we could get our bill. She said you'll have to get it from him, as she was doing nothing herself.  I asked her if she could help us get his attention and she did at that point. Let me just add that the place was not packed and the staff looked bored. I mean they had time to drink beer so I would expect they have time to give to their customers. The other locations are known for the fun ambiance and excellent customer service.

Door probably should have been locked until that time. No one greeted us, and I had to ask if they were open.  The young girl working told us they weren't open until 12. That was it.  No welcome and/or have a seat and we will serve you when everything is ready.  We almost left because of the response or lack of, but chose to wait since this is one of our favorite poke restaurants. Time passed and shortly after 12 another customer walked in and began ordering. What?  We were sitting down the whole time, and not one employee let us know they were ready for us to order. We were both extremely disappointed and left. With so many poke restaurants popping up all over the area, this one needs to improve on their customer service. We will probably give them another try.

The restaurant was out of several of their steaks and sides, but we weren't informed of this upon being seated so we ended up ordering several items before the server finally told us they had the 3rd steak my husband tried to order and I ended up getting the salmon. Once our food came out, we were brought the wrong sides and our surver also tried to give us the wrong food and wrong wine which ended up being for the table next you us. We had to ask a different server if they could bring the correct sides. It wasn't very busy so I'm not sure where the confusion was. I would have had a better experience if our server would have been more attentive and also would have at least let us know up front what they didn't have so we knew. The food was great but the service and overall experience missed the mark, so we'll try other steakhouses instead next time we're here. 2018-09-02 19:12:22 1.0\n",

The food was pretty good, but nothing exceptional, the chicken was dry and the short rib too fatty for the $55 price tag. \n",
      "The service - we had to flag our server down multiple times for water refills, to ask for the wine list once starters were done, there was no inquiry as to my friends wine or to even ask if they wanted another glass! (Which they did and we went out after dinner because not enough wine is sheer travesty) after waiting for eons for our server to come take our dessert orders we said forget it and just paid the bill. Empty dishes left on the table for far too long, sparkling water refills had to be flagged down as they disappeared with the bottle - oh and everything is in a plastic glass. Sure sure, it's a rooftop, but other places I've been in the city stick with glassware so unsure why it's different here especially at these prices.\n"

The bread products were cold and when the hostess would replenish them, they literally were just out of the freezer.  The coffee wasn't the greatest but had caffeine which is all that mattered to me.  One day they had a ham and scrambled egg mixture going on, which was tasty but the next day, it was dried scrambled eggs and paper thin bacon on the side.  Again, it's complimentary, it's not designed to satisfy your morning appetite, much less your palate, but, it'll get you through the morning.

The first night, I literally woke up to the rumble of a plane taking off at 12:40am, probably because our window was vibrating.  No kidding!  We asked the front desk agent the next morning, who BTW wasn't all that pleasant, but seemed like she had a scripted answer to the ever popular question.  We were unpacked anyway and didn't want to move so we just went to CVS and bought ear plugs, which DID help.  However, we were in an odd number room, facing the back.  I have a feeling if you got an even number room, facing the front, the noise isn't as significant.

Things went smooth for financing and delivery was on time the next day. But then when things did not work is when I experienced another side of Spencer's customer service. When I realized my fridge did not seem as cool as should be the store was closed. The following day I awoke to find my brand new fridge a whopping 55 degrees and the freezer at 65 degrees, NOT recommended for food freshness. Needless to say, ALL the food had to be tossed! I called first thing in the morning, sales rep stated he would find out what time they would be able to deliver another refrigerator, then call me back.....did not hear anything after 2 hours so I called and spoke directly to my sales rep, whom explained to me I was scheduled for the end of the day and they would call 2 hours prior to delivery. 4pm no call. 5pm a call came they would be there in 20 mins...GREAT! Another fridge was delivered and the non-working one taken away. When I called and requested what Spencer's could do for replacement of all the spoiled food (it was a few days before New Year's lots of meat wasted) I received a cold shoulder not even an apology. A few days later since it was the holiday I received a call stating they would take 50.00 off my bill! I was insulted at this point. I just spent 3 months of my salary on new appliances and due to the defect of their refrigerator was out another several hundred dollars. \"Extraordinary service\" as they state is only when you have NO issues, not when you really need their service. They pride themselves on being \"family owned, family operated business\", maybe they need to take better care of the customers of their community. Long story made short: I felt everything went smoothly with smiles on their faces until my money was secured for payment. Then when I showed concerns about defected merchandise and taking ownership of their products, difficulties arose and the interest in service towards me vanished.

      "Just like last Sunday, Jerry J. and I were on the prowl  last night (7/31/11) for some food to celebrate having one whole day this week, off from work today (Monday.) After driving home from work and getting picked up, Jerry suggested that we drive down by where he lives (Sunset Station) rather than by where I live (GVR) - there was nothing open, the cafe inside of Sunset was closed until 6 AM for cleaning and for whatever reason, Jerry doesn't think it's okay to take girls to bars for a proper meal. The only option was Denny's or IHOP over there and he said he didn't care for either, so we drove back up to GVR. Everything was closed there, so we ended up at Denny's on Eastern. Eff. We drove around for an hour for nothing!\n",

      "The place was pretty dead at a little after midnight. There was only two tables that had people at them. We got the menus and... Jerry said nothing was jumping out to him. I'm not a big fan of Denny's - their food isn't very good anymore, so I agreed. They have some new menu out that has \"regional\" dishes and I was really eyeing the shrimp and grits. All of the sudden, common sense took over as I pondered how good the quality of seafood, at a Denny's, in a desert would be, and that the grits probably were of the instant variety. The waitress had to check on us three times before we were ready to order because we were too busy chatting to look over our menu. Good thing she was patient with us. When it was time, Jerry ordered a burger and fries, and I settled on the peach french toast, with two sunny side eggs, 2 sausage links and hash browns for $5.99 \n",

      "The food came out quickly. My toast, and what I think were canned peaches, were a little black on the edges, but it was okay. The eggs were not good - they had a thick, congealed, clear layer on top - something I've never seen on eggs I've made sunny side up at home. They weren't good quality and they tasted...not good. You can tell the quality of an egg - the better the quality, the more orange the yolk. Of course, quality eggs come from chickens that were fed bugs and worms and quality feed and were allowed to scratch around outside. These yolks were highlighter-yellow and tasteless. Poor chickens.  \n",

      " WRHwXMFuM8f-7qpXN70HWg I like to give every place a second chance, but this place received one by default.  I went here recently, having just come from out of town on the way to a job interview.  I am trying to grow my nails out/strengthen the nail beds,  so planned to forego gel polish, but since no one asked, offered, or recommended anything in the way of gel polish, specials, combos, etc., when directed, I chose a regular polish. (None of the three technicians were occupied when I entered.) The tech did show me the card to choose my pedicure. The chair was very relaxing; no real complaints about the pedicure, though I was a little embarrassed by the cleavage of the young lady (and I'm not a prude); pretty decent callous removal, even though I only chose  the \"regular\" pedicure; leg massage was very nice. When it was time for the manicure (same tech) I was asked about filing a little and evening out, and what shape, to which I said yes, just file a little and square-rounded. Next thing I knew she had clipped my longest nail with a pair of big clippers, then proceeded to clip them all (no need stopping her at that point because it would have looked weird); however, the one nail I had expected to be clipped and filed wasn't even touched. I thought it had been fixed during the cuticle work, but even hang nails were missed, as discovered later.  The polish went on and even then seemed a bit thick, but, hey - I'm not the technician. After she started the polish, she asked why I didn't like gel; I told her no one mentioned it, but I didn't want my nail beds filed on, like I have had done before, to which she replied they don't do that there; even though I expressed interest, she made no suggestion to do it or start over.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was moved over to the UV drying station and just left there for 10 min. or so. Needing to get to my interview, I looked at the manager, standing behind the counter, and asked if he thought they were ready; he said oh, sure...didn't even check, but I got the feeling he was waiting for me, so I gathered my things carefully and went to pay. When I asked the name of my technician, he didn't even know, but did find out. I noticed one of my nails smudge so asked if I could/should dry some more. I waited another ten min. and left. Within a few minutes, even though super careful, three nails looked like they had just melted...the whole shebang had slid down toward my cuticle! Not having any time, I smoothed them and poured water on them ASAP (a quick set trick from an old manicurist), and hid my fingers during the interview. (Note: toes were just fine, even after slamming into shoes for interview; four hours afterward, my fingernails were still mushy and pitting!)\n",
      "\n",
      " I planned to chalk it up to \"lesson learned\", but found myself in the area the next afternoon and decided to see if they would fix my manicure. While much busier, the lady manager (I think, no one introduced themselves ever!) came right over and loudly proclaimed they would fix for free, though she denied anything being wrong with the polish, that it was probably my fault for rushing...but why hadn't I done gel nails? I explained. She called up another technician (the guy manager did remember my technician's name from day before), still loudly declaring they would fix but I must stay longer. When I mentioned my toes were fine, that I thought they may want to take that bottle of polish down, they said toenails dry differently than fingernails and the polish works differently. REALLY? Which turnip truck do you think I fell off of? I decided to ask if they would discount a gel manicure, and they knocked $10 off, handed me over to the new manicurist, amid much foreign chatter and what appeared to be an attempt to hide me from the previous manicurist. (I see someone else mentioned the huge amount of giggling, seeming side exchanges, and foreign conversation, which I do find to be a little disrespectful.) My new caretaker was polite, made suggestions/created my color, but did ask why I liked my nails so short; though I think that was a little impertinent (but not as much as her cleavage; no I am NOT a weirdo, but worse than the day before!), I responded I didn't, that her colleague had snipped them off! This gal did some prep, continuing to extol the wonders of gel polish, had me wash up without soap, and finished the manicure. I ended up being moved near my manicurist from the previous day, explained what happened, suggested she may want to take the polish down, to which the present manicurist rolled her eyes and clicked her tongue. While she did a decent job, the polish ran over my cuticles to some degree (and now 4 days later, polish is beginning to flake off at edges). I paid; I left...and won't go back.  I'm sure this place is good for some, but not for me.    Note: The shop is quiet enough, no fumes, fairly clean - though never did see sterilized equipment, and the restroom/hall area were kind of dingy. 2013-09-17 20:44:53 1.0\n",

They have a large selection of sushi and rolls, but very few sashimi options (no tuna; crab stick is not sashimi in my opinion). The problem is that when we ordered a few dishes from the kitchen (tempura, edaname, grilled squid, eggplant, etc.) none of them were good (just salt, grease and sugar) and the waitress brought out a large amount at a time. So for three of us dining, the kitchen staff assumes that we ordered for three, when in fact only one of us wanted an item and marked one (1) in the menu. So we ended up eating more of the greasy food and less sushi. This strategy probably worked in favour of the owner, who may lose money on sashimi. So I recommend communicating clearly with the waiter how much of the non-sushi item you want when marking it on the sheet.  Also, the bathroom could be cleaner. 2014-05-15 19:02:00 1.0\n",

And then you have the temerity to say it was an empty plate. I KID YOU NOT, the mans tried to argue with me that there was nothing on the plate. And then he proceeded to tell me that it's on the kitchen table, he will bring it back, that it hasn't been thrown out yet. Are you ready for this next bit? (As if that last statement wasn't messed up enough on its own, bout \"on the kitchen table, bring it back\"). THIS GUY BRINGS BACK SOME NEXXX PERSON'S HALF EATEN MEAL. #DEAD. Yelp, I can't even make this shit up if I tried. I was so flabbergasted and shocked, I didn't know how to respond to that. So, I kind of just stood there in silence for a moment with bewilderment in eyes, I straight up looked anencephalic. MY GAWD. Oh yeah, and then they asked us to pay for the meal we never ate (These guys lol). The manager got involved, after 15 infuriating minutes of arguing, they offered a free dessert, I didn't want dessert, so it was finally voided. But in a restaurant as \"reputable\" as The Octagon, who markets themselves a certain way and ensures a \"fine-dining\" experience, I feel like it should've been handled much more professionally, and the problem should've never arisen to begin with. The offer to void the meal should've come from their end without a debate. What kind of business argues with their patrons and shames them?! \n",

My issue was with the manager who worked there. She was very unprofessional and did not listen to any of my concerns. When I made my appointments I specifically told them that I am only paying for makeup and that some of my ladies with be getting their hair done on their own and that I do not want their hair to go under my contract. Well needless to say she did not care about this and I ended up paying for the hair too, when I told the manager that I was not suppose to pay for the hair she just gave me a smug smirk and said, \"What you want me to refund you the money, and have them pay for it?\" and then she laughed like it was something ridiculous to do. One of my bridesmaids actually had walk away because she could not take how the manager was talking down to and treating me. On top of that when I went for my trial I was told that eyelashes are included ($15 value, but they are ardelle brand that you can get at walgreens for $5) but I could upgrade to the Mink Winks and just pay the difference. Well when on the day of my wedding I upgraded they charged by the full amount $35 and when I asked the manager about this charge she told me that, that is not how it is done and that there is nothing that can be done about it, really?

      " N5oodbuCDlCxNPouXJYaNQ I visited this salon yesterday and just asked for a simple cut. My stylist barely talked to me after I showed her the picture of what I wanted and didn't have a friendly attitude. The whole experience took about 20 minutes and I was charged $75! For a super simple cut I could've gotten at Super Cuts! They did give me a glass of wine and a little bag of samples when I left, but I was not impressed with the experience or the price tag at this place. 2015-09-23 13:08:32 1.0\n",

      " 0PZbO7wnPaKifkbj8jZcfg I grew up in the area. The first time I went to The Octagon restaurant, I was probably 5-6 years old. My parents went every 2 weeks for many years (until I was in my late teens). I used to LOVE The Octagon, I always recommended it to anyone who was looking for delicious ribs, steak etc. I was there 2 weeks ago for lunch. Probably my first time in 5 years. I feel like there is so much more hype to the name now then there should be for the food. \n",

We had to flag down our waiter to ask for everything - water, wine, coffee, more garlic bread, our bill etc. Surprised at the service considering the fact that there were many familiar faces - most of them have worked there for almost 20 years. \n",

Hate to be negative, but our room, while quite clean, was on the small side and noisy.

The front desk personnel were very nice, check out and in went smoothly. Not a ghastly stay by any means, but we've visited many better Hamptons.

Despite most of the staff being nice to your face, at least two were quite unprofessional. I made it clear that I was flying at a busy time and would need a timely shuttle to the airport. One of the staff booked the flight in a friendly manner but did not actually write it down. By the time I was waiting downstairs there was no evidence of a shuttle having been booked. This by itself would not have merited a 2 star review but the lady working the desk on a Sunday night did not so much as apologize. She just acted like it wasn't her fault and didn't know what happened. I had a polite conversation suggesting that such an attitude led to a poor customer experience but she acted as if she could not care less. 2016-04-11 05:11:06 1.0\n",

Finished my manicure and sat at the drying table for maybe 10 minutes (this was without shellac). As we were driving, my friend's nailpolish started smudging and coming off. Mine followed soon after.

      "After a long day of long flights from the East Coast to Las Vegas, I settled in for a very early night. I was actually sleeping by 8:30 pm. However, I was awakened at 10:30 pm by very loud music and talking from the room next door. After 10 minutes of hoping that the noise would die down, I called the front desk. The night clerk sent someone up and the music died down, but only 10 minutes later, the noise started, again. Another call to the front desk resulted in a call and another visit to the room next door, and the noise died down, again. But shortly thereafter, the party continued in the hallway. I waited five minutes hoping that that the party was on its way out, but finally stuck my head out the door. There was a group of well dressed kids with red Solo cups in their hands talking in the hallway. I said, \"Would you please keep it down?\", and someone responded, \"Put a shirt on, dude!\", so I closed the door and called the front desk, again. Thankfully, the third visit from the hotel staff quieted the party down for the rest of the night and I was able to sleep until dawn.\n",

The clerk explained that the hotel shuttle had broken down and was out of service for a couple of hours; the van that had picked me up was a replacement. Now, why the day clerk and the van driver couldn't have told me that, instead of lying about \"bad traffic\" due to non-existent construction and an imaginary accident is beyond me.\n",

I purchased a refrigerator, stove and microwave on August 9th and we were doing remodeling so I asked for an afternoon delivery on the 16th. (Figured scheduling a week out would be safe for getting a preferred delivery time) So much for that... The salesperson says pick a morning or afternoon delivery; might as well been playing blackjack!!! They call on the morning of the 16th and want to deliver first thing in the morning. Why even offer morning or afternoon if you have no control? People have to work for a living.. Did you forget that??? Way to ruin me and my wife's week! Apparently in talking with my salesperson you have to tell them your refrigerator went out and need it the next morning and that drives their schedule. Wish I wouldn't have bought all what I did from them. I've purchased from many stores; Best Buy, pruitts, room store and never had these problems!!!

We got off to a rocky start with their maintenance company, but they did resolve all issues (after many upset phone calls from me), but regardless, it got corrected. Fortunately I have family near by who was keeping an eye on things until it was rented out. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were pleased that they found, what we were told, were qualified tenants quickly. The rental person claimed they had no children except for an exchange student who would only be there for a month (not an issue, we didn't ask if they had kids since it was a 5 bedroom house and expected a family to live there. This information was offered). \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything went along ok for the most part. The time came that we were ready to sell our home. We got real estate agents. They needed to go over to the house and check it out, take pictures, etc. We contacted the tenants directly and told them what was happening. We also floated the idea of them buying it if they were interested. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, to make a long story short, our realtors found out that the tenants had credit issues and could not buy the house and they had children. (Again, not an issue, but we were told differently, which was the issue). So, in essence we were lied to by On Q. They had no reason to lie to us. It certainly wasn't the tenants fault that they lied. We understood the tenants' credit issues. We had been in the same boat 5 years before. That really upset us that they lied. We were very fortunate that they were good tenants, paid on time, kept the home in reasonable condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, now the tenants move and its time to finish our business with On Q. That took FOREVER or what felt like it anyway. We tried to email and call our property manager, Rebeccah. She wouldn't get back to us in a timely fashion. She never did end up returning my husband's calls to this day. When she would email back, it must have been right as she was walking out the door for the day because it was 9 PM east coast time, which is where we live and we couldn't reach her after that to respond. I called over there and ended up talking to their accounting department, who was very professional, unlike our property manager. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our microwave came up missing. Rebeccah did call the tenants about that. Again, I have family that was keeping an eye on the place. They first claimed there was no microwave (not true, had pictures). They finally after 3 weeks (no thanks to Rebeccah) returned a microwave that was clearly not ours. From the pictures I was sent it was filthy, still had food in it, YUCK. I immediately told her to get that filthy thing out of my house and give it back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, supposedly the tenants furnished a receipt that they had the house cleaned and the carpets cleaned, which Rebeccaah put in her report to. There was NO WAY the carpets had been cleaned as per the lease. Instead of Rebeccah maybe telling the tenants this (if I paid for work that wasn't done, I'd certainly call the company that was supposed to do it!), she let it go. This was clearly in the lease that carpets were to be professionally cleaned upon move out!!!! I ended up flying out there to see what the heck was going on with our home. Found that the carpets were barely vacuumed or vacuumed with a broken vacuum. As I vacuumed them, I found clothing tags and the little plastic thing that connects the tag to the cloth, even old food. Trim was missing from the garage door into the house (what was that about?????) Fortunately that appeared to be the only big issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a family member pick up all the keys (or so I thought). Next thing I know, my real estate agent says there is still a lock box from On Q on my property! Seriously????? I told Rebeccah to get the lock box out of there by the end of the business day the next day. There was no reason for that lock box to be there. They had no right to be in my house at that point!!!! Next thing I know, they never returned the POS microwave that the tenants returned and had to get it back. Was this woman kidding???? I was livid by that point. I told her to take the cost of our microwave out of their security deposit (receipt was sent to her for that microwave) since it was about a month later and to CLOSE MY ACCOUNT. \n",
      "\n",
      "Supposedly there was some miscommunication. Regardless, there was no need from ANYONE from that company to be inside of my house by that point. Beings that their maintenance department literally broke into my house in the beginning of our contract, we were furious with them. I would not recommend them, or at least not Rebeccah to be your property manager. The other staff that I had dealt with were pleasant and friendly. But these people lied to us, then wouldn't talk to us, had an unauthorized lock box on our house after my family picked up all the keys!!! \n",

I am a regular at Starbucks, and usually I go to the location on Losee and Centennial inside Smiths. When I don't feel like going inside, I will come to this location but it's a mistake every time. The majority of the time I come here, I would say 8/10, my drink is wrong. I order a grande iced coffee with cream and sweetener - a very simple drink in comparison to many others. Every time there is either loads of creamer, sweetener, or just no sweetener at all. Being that this is the second time within 2 days that I have to drive back through the drive thru to have my coffee fixed, I am annoyed. This time, when I drove back around and asked the woman if I could have sweetener added, she did a long sigh and turned around to fix it. I don't know if she was frustrated with her coworkers about the mistake or me but Im not paying a ridiculous amount just to end up throwing it away because I won't drink the coffee. They fix my coffee each time with no problem, and although I do appreciate that I would prefer my coffee to be correct the first time. This location just seems to be very unorganized. Do not come to this location if you are in a rush, as the line takes ages and inside is no better. Always taste your drink before driving off, or even walking out because they have also made mistakes on my drink when I go inside. Usually I would not complain about something like this and just be relieved they fixed it, but I don't come here as a coffee lover to get a messed up overpriced drink - that could start anyone's morning off wrong! 2017-04-17 15:42:46 1.0\n",

      " sivH2JYG1KANbFiiW5QmLw So, let me begin by saying we have stayed at the REAL Tahiti Village resorts that are on Las Vegas Blvd.  We booked this trip last December for Tahiti Village.  I am not sure who's fault it is-but when us and our 5 teenagers arrived to check in at Tahiti Village-we were told that we were actually placed at Tahiti Resort.  Upon arrival, Tahiti Vacation Resort is the K-Mart of Hotels.  It was OK-but the WiFi service reminded me of dial-up or the 3G days.  There is absolutely NO phone service in the rooms or the hotel.  We asked if we could at least see the rooms, were not even allowed to see the rooms before officially checking in.  We wanted to see if they were large enough for our 7-person family, but she said we had to check in and pay in order to see them.  Upon paying hundreds of dollars, we walk to our room.  The rooms are OK-really, if the pool wasn't so depressing, we could have made it work.  We booked a room to sleep 8(Which Tahiti Village has)-we got a room that slept six, so one kid was on the floor for a night.  We tried to talk to the floor management, who was a woman but I don't remember her name, but she was absolutely no help.  We asked if we could switch to Tahiti Village where we were supposed to be because she told us it was a sister hotel, but she said she would look into it, stalled and never responded or returned our calls as she said she was going to call her manager to ask if we could cancel the reservation for the next two nights (side note-Tahiti Village said it happens all the time and it is not their fault - most people are super mad when this happens to them too!) We ended up walking down there after numerous calls and her saying I will call you back when I contact her and ask her and let you know.  An hour later we walked back down to the desk, she hadn't called the manager at all yet and called her when we were there.  She was not any help, and honestly sounded like she could care less about anything.  After two hours of back and forth with the woman at the desk who refused to assist us, we ended up making another reservation at the real Tahiti Village.  We sucked it up and stayed in that room and left as soon as we could the next day.  We ate the three nights we paid for because it is that bad. So, a 3-night vacation that was supposed to cost us $700- ended up costing us $1600 just for the hotel cost.  The real Tahiti Village is AMAZING!  The lazy river is to die for and the regular pool that they have in addition to their amazing lazy river, blows the two pools that are at the Tahiti Vacation Resort out of the park.  The two pools that are at Tahiti Vacation Resort are incredibly basic, although they do have a small section of sand on one side in each pool.  We arrived to dozens of towels laying out, apple cores laying all over the ground, chairs were in the pool, and no towels were available for my family.  Like I said, the rooms are OK-and if you haven't been to the real Tahiti Village and don't plan to spend a lot of time in the pools like we did, this place is ok although their management needs an upgrade.  They do have a basic continental breakfast with muffins, bagels, bananas, apples, orange juice, hot cocoa and coffee.  We did not mind too much having to stay there the first night.  What made us angry, was their refusal to comp us, or allow us to cancel with a 20 hour advance the next two nights for the reservation, so lucky us, we were stuck.  If we had stayed there, our vacation would have been a bust.  Tahiti Vacation Club management-please advise.  I do not recommend this place unless you're a senior citizen wanting peace and quiet away from nice pools and families. 2017-06-23 02:31:42 1.0\n",

She told me they ran a test and the water was a slight brown color with no feet but not as dark . I noticed my water was brown and dark green , the same color as other yelp photos . So , I continued to sip on my tea and watch this brown to dark green water fill up the foot spa . I finished paid $40 - minus the yelp $10 .00 coupon and off I went . \n",

I ordered the Pepino salad, asked for no tomatoes, and the other 3 in my party got 1/4 chicken and two sides. My salad came with no feta, no arugula and no salad dressing (which it was supposed to have on it).  It did however come with the tomatoes I asked them to leave off. It was basically $10 for romaine, onion, tomatoes and chicken and in a puddle of water. One of the sides with the 1/4 chicken was incorrect and the guy that brought it out seemed frustrated and short with us when we explained what it was supposed to be. I had to ask twice for the dressing for my salad. The food overall was pretty underwhelming. Perhaps they need more\n",

      "The first thing that we experienced was the manager (Sabrina maybe?) at the hostess station who seemed flustered and unprepared to receive customers. She was out at the station but was still taking off her coat and scarf and seemed to be stashing some sort of take out food under the hostess station. When she spoke to us, she was brusque and lacked any sort of warmth. Even when we told her that we had never been there all she offered as information was that they had general seating, hibachi seating, a sushi bar and a regular bar and asked us where we wanted to sit and then handed off a menu so she could take a call. Over all, this was something that kind of lowered our expectations for the experience\n",
      "\n",
      "We elected to sit in the bar area as we were interested in dishes from two different parts of the menu. The bar top itself is VERY blue and lighted from underneath. Not a bad thing, just something that we weren't expecting. It wasn't really making our experience better since it was so bright so we moved to one of the granite top tables still in the bar area. Oddly enough, the stools/chairs for the granite tables are bolted to the floor so don't worry about scooting in to be closer to the table, you can't! For anyone who is larger, those chairs will not be comfortable because they are very narrow and just close enough to the table to not be comfortable. On the other hand, if you are smaller, still not a comfortable seating situation because you will be too far from the table if you sit in the chair instead of on the edge of it. We shared the Rum Volcano and the chair and table situation made that an interesting experience. The drink itself was very good, just hard to reach. The bartender (Lauren maybe?) was very sweet and took great care of us and mentioned that she takes great pride in her drinks. \n",

      "Food was just meh. He had the Sumo Pineapple Fried Rice which was over and under seasoned all at the same time. It had way too much curry powder and turmeric in it, and not nearly enough salt, acid, or cumin in it. I would have even put some pineapple juice in it to help balance out the flavors. The shrimp in it were huge though so that was nice. I had the eel roll and the Alaska roll and the Nagiri octopus sushi. The eel had as many bones in it as I would expect from cheap grocery store sushi rather than a restaurant. The Alaska roll had very uneven distribution of ingredients which made the roll loose and a little difficult to eat. On the bright side, the fish was fresh and cold and did not have any off flavors to it at all. \n",

      "At the end of the meal, we asked the hostess if there might be a comment card that we could fill out as we wanted to leave some feedback and we were told adamantly no and then she brushed us off. Instead, when we got our receipt, we wrote some notes on the back of it and handed it to her. Despite the fact that she was not busy (we waited to make sure she didn't have anyone to wait on) she took the notes with a huff and shoved them under the hostess station without even looking at them. The bartender, on the other hand, did listen to our comments and said that she would be happy to relay them to the staff and genuinely seemed to care about the feedback saying that it was important to get feedback to make the restaurant better since they are brand new. \n",

I suspect that there was a traveling group of chefs that opened this place to get good reviews and they moved on. Our cook gave a mediocre show at best and did not interact with any of our group. We did see other hibachi shows near us that were much better than ours. The food was actually pretty good but others in my group thought it was bland and flavorless. It was around 25 bucks for steak and scallops so the price was not too bad. This place was very crowed and can probably seat two hundred people at once if needed.

I attempted to order on Postmates, and I guess I started my order before they flipped the \"too busy\" switch so was a little confused when I wasn't able to complete the order.  Instead, we called in a pick up order and were told the wings would be 30 minutes, which would be alright but I'd rather not wait, so canceled that part of the order.  I wish I wouldn't have, though because the order we went with took longer than that anyway and was of much lower quality than past orders.

The inside of the restaurant seemed huge and the atmosphere was nice for a sports bar.  They have a pretty decent menu.  I ended up getting the smothered chicken with sweet potato fries.  My food was really good.  The sweet potato fries are pretty amazing because they drizzle some kind of sweet honey butter sauce on top.  The service was just ok, nothing outstanding.  Sadly the one thing that stands out to me for this restaurant was the sea salt hand moisturizer in the bathroom.  This stuff was amazing and left my hands nice and smooth after visiting the restroom.  They actually sell jars of the moisturizer at the hostess station but I couldn't justify spending $25 dollars for it.  I'll definitely be back to this restaurant to give it another try. 2010-09-09 17:06:11 1.0\n",

First, they had no lunch specials, which for a student like me is gold!  Second, our appetizer came as I was almost finishing up my meal.  Not sure why that took so long.  And it wasn't even that tasty -- was actually quite bland.  I ordered a simple beef on rice dish.  The beef was meh, rice was good, and the little salad on the side was fine.  But this dish felt very much like something you could get at a Ginger restaurant (which I love).  My friend ordered a seafood soup, and he commented that the seafood entailed 2 shrimp.  It was a big soup, but he was a bit disappointed too. \n",

Most of the meat platters were about 11.95.  So for lunch (and as a student!) this was a bit steeper than what we were hoping for.  I'd still rather grab sushi for 5.99 and get a nice variety of foods.  I probably wouldn't return. 2010-12-01 14:34:01 1.0\n",

You can order AYCE or you can order off the menu (everyone gets AYCE), however if one person gets AYCE in your table, nobody else can order from the menu, everyone HAS to get AYCE. Basically, they give a you a large selection of meat and there is a grill in the middle where you essentially cook the meat yourself given a pair of tongs per person. Meats include beef, marinated chicken, lamb, squid, fish, etc. \n",

However, the meat here is  LOW quality meat and full of grease and nasty preservatives. The food is very very greasy and may give you a stomach ache afterwards if you eat way too much. Also, although they say it is \"Korean BBQ\" the chain is actually Chinese owned and the BBQ here is not authentic korean bbq. Authentic korean BBQ has much higher grade meat and is generally not AYCE. If you are craving a lot of meat and/or are with a large group of friends and you want some AYCE this place is great.

Typical Outback decor and was clean and decent.  Amanda, our server was fantastic and friendly which kept the third star because the food was just plain mediocre at best.  My daughter had the filet and lobster tail.  The lobster was overdone and a bit chewy, but since this was her first time with lobster and she didn't seem to care for the taste, I didn't send it back.  My wife had the chicken and filet and she liked it but didn't care for the mesquite taste the chicken had.  That was not Outback's issue, since it was wood fired LOL! Point is, if you like the wood fired taste then it's definitely there.  I had the 10-ounce Rib-eye ordered medium rare.  It was served with barely any pink in the middle.  In other words, medium to medium well.  The manager came by for a visit and I pointed this out and she agreed that this was definitely not medium rare and offered to get me another which was nice, but I chose to keep it and not make the rest of the family wait for me.  So, two over-cooked dishes out of three.  One of which was a steak.  If you bill yourself as a steak house, like Outback does, you should never, ever serve an improper steak.  I just don't get that.

Quel beau concept, qui semble plutôt populaire dans les restaurants coréens de Toronto. Le midi le menu populaire est AYCE. Alors au milieu de la table une plaque chauffante de style BBQ alimentée au gaz autour de laquelle nous sommes assis. Sur le menu plusieurs sortes de viandes; poulet, boeuf, porc. À cela s'ajoute du filet de sole et du calmar. Alors, pour le AYCE, le serveur remet une feuille avec les choix de viandes et les accompagnements (soupe, riz, tofu, fèves germées épicées et nature, Kim chi). On fait le choix de ce que l'on veut puis remet la feuille au serveur. Il ouvre le gaz sous notre grille et nous attendons notre commande. Les viandes et poissons arrivent crus à la table, nous les mettons sur la plaque chauffante et faisons notre cuisson. Les viandes sont biens assaisonnées et gouteuses. Le choix est restreint pour le dîner, j'imagine qu'il est plus élaboré à l'heure du souper. Les portions des plats d'accompagnement, à l'exception du riz, sont petites. Le resto était plein et semble populaire et apprécié. Pour un bouffe qui ne demande aucune cuisson du chef, j'ai trouvé le service extrêmement long. C'est une bouffe légère qui demande de la patience, mais c'est très agréable. Mon mari dit y avoir bu le meilleur smoothie à la mangue. 2013-09-15 11:31:25 1.0\n",

It is the most savory, delicious, juicy beef you ever tasted, dare I say better than a ribeye or Philly cheesesteak?  Of course, the rib eye will fill you up, but this is like a delicacy, an amuse bouche.  It won't fill you up unless you have like four orders of it, but think of it as bacon.  You don't want to fill up on bacon.  Maybe I should get a Smashburger across the street and put three strips of the Yoshi beef on it.  Wow.  I'm doing that my next trip to Vegas.  So why only 3 stars?  Well, everything else is gross.  Sorry.  It's fast food for crying out loud.  I'm not taking a date here.  You also don't get a lot of the beef for your money.  The gyoza is frozen and nuked or something and has freezer burn.  Seriously, it's not a gourmet Japanese restaurant.  It's Japanese junk with the most amazing beef strips you ever had in your life.

Daniel came to the house and fixed the leaK, great. but after my pool pump shut off the skimmer blew up. To find out there was air in the system.  I called Daniel he said that shouldn't happen, but it did. I found that I had to prime my pumps every morning, I knew that wasn't right. I finally got the air out on my own after many questions to friends. I called and left messages with Aaron pools, it was the Memorial Day weekend and knew no one would be there until Tuesday.  They said they called and left a message, never happened probably dialed wrong. my understanding is that 2 men came on Tuesday at 2, I was home, they never rang the bell. they changed o rings, the pool turned all white and the skimmer blew again. I called them to come back but they wouldn't until I called my warrenty company. they said it was a filter problem and that was a different issue. the receptionist was no help she didn't know how to handle people that are upset. I spoke to Nancy the office manager,  a little more understanding. finally 2 days later they came back. the tech who's name I thought was Stetson but from reading another review it might be Westin, he was early, great, he walked in the backyard took one look at the pool and said your water level is to low. I said should the other guys have noticed that? he just smiled. he said once the pool fills you will never have to prime it and there won't be air in the system. He double checked my filter he said there wasn't any problem with it. everything has been working perfect since. so what I am really saying is make sure Westin or (Stetson) is the tech to come out. he really is very knowledgeable. and a gentlemen. 2014-06-04 14:06:31 1.0\n",

Once upstairs, I found my friends and sat down.  They were already halfway into dinner service and they let me know that the service was horrible and no one really understood english.  I wasn't going for the All You Can Eat so we asked the waiter for a menu so I could order an item from their dinner menu.  It took them at least ten minutes to bring the menu over and another ten minutes to get my order put through and fill up our cups with water and tea.  The dinner itself, surprisingly, was not too long of a wait and I decided on the Beef Bibimbap, which was very tasty and I demolished the whole thing myself.  While I was eating my dinner, my coworkers were on dessert.  Little did they know that ice cream was not included in AYCE and you have to pay an extra $2 something to order ice cream (which only consisted of chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, green tea and red bean).  Other korean restaurants I've been to for AYCE has always included ice cream and a wide variety of desserts in their dinner service.. None the less, I think I'll stick to my regular korean BBQ restaurants that charge more for AYCE dinner and includes dessert and sushi with better customer service.  Korean Grill House will probably be my last resort for last minute cravings for korean BBQ, the food is delicious don't get me wrong.

I was hoping to find the same bread that I got in Virginia--one that had all seeds, but they told me they all do their own thing. That bread was the best bread I ever had. I still get their white bread and honey bread. The bread is pricey, but I do love them. I love how they give free, huge slices of bread with butter on them to try. I've taken advantage of this to try some of their desserts. Sometimes I'll like them enough to buy them. Although I love their bread, this store only deserves three stars (possibly less) because they are seriously lacking in customer service.

It was about $20 a person which is pretty standard for AYCE bbq so don't let the $$ rating of this restaurant scare you. In comparison to a lot of the korean bbq restaurants at korea town I definitely felt like this place had better meat then the rest. The short ribs and beef were our favourite meats. The fish was came apart pretty quickly and the chicken took a really long time to cook (but this is all typical when it comes to kbbq) so beware of that. My first complaint about this place is that they wouldn't accept debit card but they still took credit cards for some reason... I don't know if it was just because their machine was down for the day or what but it was very frustrating for me and my friends. However, my biggest complaint was the ordering process at this restaurant. The way it works is you fill out a form and state how many orders you want (ie 2x orders of ribs, 3x orders of kimchi, etc). We found that the kitchen often ignored our orders and gave us what they felt was best instead of what we wanted. Since we all really like kimchi we ordered 1 for each of us (5x kimchis total) but they only gave us 2 at a time! The same thing happened when we ordered other side dishes and sometimes with the meat too. I feel that if they aren't willing to give as much as the customers want, then they really shouldn't be offering an AYCE option because it gets frustrating. 2015-10-30 04:21:28 1.0\n",

      " w2u5zfRDsuQpCPJq9bXbQg We had a party of 7 on a busy Saturday. After paying for our drinks from the bar before being seated @ our table, the wait staff appeared a bit rushed to take our order. In fact, while our friends were just digging into their Caesar salads, the staff brought out the mains. The food was quite good and we did manage to monopolize the table regardless of the impatient staff. We ordered a piece of chocolate to go. PS the Cosmo costs $12.00! A bit much for a few sips! 2016-02-21 03:16:17 1.0\n",

We were just ordering drinks, but I glanced over the appetizer menu. There weren't many options and not 1 dip on the menu!! What!! Dip is life! But like I said, we were only getting drinks. \n",

      "\n",
      "First off,  food isnt the problem. The meat is freshly ground and grilled so no precooked frozen generic patty, so plus there. The topping are alot but  some have quite the extra charge like avocado but if you stick to signature as is, you will be fine with the way it prepared and taste.  Food get 4/5 for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Its price and quantity that is issue with that give me the mixed reaction. Most signature burger are around 10 buck and the size of what you expect a double cheeseburger which are usually small in size which these are, I feel like for the size it should be 6 dollar burger at best. So if I were to just review it on that price would get 2 for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the special offer of a signature burger of the day were it 2 for 1 deal means you get 2 for 10 buck or 1 for 5 which I think is a reasonable deal. The deal is what save this place from 2 star for having overprice burgers while it still there taking advantage of the deal make it more of better deal so the get 3-3.5/5\n",

Sink around faucets is black, my hands felt dirty after washing than before!.  Silverware dispenser is covered with splatters of bbq sauce.  Door handles dirty.  It makes it hard to enjoy the bbq, which is quite tasty, when you see how dirty the surroundings are.  I'm surprised manager or owner doesn't notice these things and insist that everything get a thorough cleaning!  Also, the large pots that hold the bbq sauce should really have nozzle dispensers.  When people use the ladle to pour sauce into small plastic containers, sauce runs over their fingers and back into the pot.  Not appetizing. 2016-04-09 06:42:04 1.0\n",

I usually get the triple \"compressor\" burger combo with the fries on a stick/skewer and a pop.

I was hoping this was a one-off bad burger experience, but another reviewer warned that you should be prepared to like your burger overly charred and over well done. That's a shame.

      " gFOzvSOGxpCiPDht8c2EMg I've been here a few times years back, seem to recall that their pho is ok but nothing else really stands out.  Came here for quick bite on a cloudy Sunday.  Had deep fried spring roll as appetizer and pho tai nam for the lunch.  It's a small, family run business so one can tell they are under staff and service tends to be slow in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Spring roll comes with bean sprout and lettuce, it was perfectly fried with good flavour, but skin tends to be wrong.  Onto the pho itself, I'd say the broth is clean and subtle, obviously not the best I've had but one of the better choice around Chinatown.  They use ho fan instead of dry vermicelli like many use, which is good.  But all pho comes with one standard size and they do skimp on the meat tho.  \n",

I proceeded to order the most common meal here - a cherry coke, a Special with Swiss, and a sour pickle. In my opinion, everything was A-ok, and upon first glance it stereotypically looked like what I jokingly call \"white people food,\" except it was actually pretty good and tasted better than it looked. \n",

The mustard, however, didn't come through for whatever reason. Maybe the sourness of the pickle I was eating at the same time ended up drowning out the flavor? I don't know, but it was a bit disappointed given that mustard is one of my favorite Western condiments. As for the cherry cola, classic fountain drinks always give me a cool vibe, as if it could make a person cooler just by drinking out of a glass of it. For a place with so much history to it, it didn't disappoint on that aspect.\n",

We have been looking forward to the opening of Smokin' Q's since we heard about it! We sat at the bar for a late lunch on Saturday, June 10th. As other reviewers have stated, there were so many employees standing around and talking that it made us uncomfortable and no one seemed to have anything to do. The two employees behind the bar spent a good 15-20 minutes complaining about how many hours they were working. The bar is not a large area so there was no avoiding their conversation. We were ready to order, after the shock of $5 sides slightly wore off. Our server was taking our orders, and as he turned away from my husband to take my order, the manager said to our server \"So I heard you came in a little late today, huh?\" How is this at all appropriate to bring up in front of customers!? I said \"Please have your conversation after I'm finished ordering.\" \n",

We were told they had no sourdough bread, so we both subbed for honey wheat. My sandwich came quickly, and was delicious, but SMALL. After 10 minutes, we still didn't have my friend's sandwich (same exact one). Another 10 minutes passed and no one really looked like they were doing anything. When we finally get their attention, what do you know? They lost the \"ticket\" so they forgot about making the sandwich. Only a few minutes after that the sandwich came out (with sourdough bread), with no reference to the fact that it took almost 25  minutes longer to make that one. We noticed a young girl behind the counter handling the bread without gloves. It was the same girl who works the register, so I can't imagine it's hygienic to handle money and then handle ANYTHING without gloves. When I went up to ask for the manager the girl simply asked, \"do you want a cookie or something, or do you want me to comp your meal?\" But still no apology, and didn't even ask for feedback. They wound up refunding both of our meals, but the young employees should probably receive training on how to be more attentive and customer service oriented. 2018-06-30 00:35:38 1.0\n",

Sometimes the base is flavourful and other times it is water-downed.  Therefore, I stick to the rice dishes.  Their prices are modest (e.g. $6.95 for bbq pork/chicken with rice dish, $6.50 bbq pork vermicilli and spring roll dish, and $4.95 for small pho). One of the reasons I loved going here was because the staff were warm helpful.  They would even bring a small bowel with scissors for my little one (to cut her food into small pieces -- really helpful).  I am not sure if there has been ownership changes, but the last couple of times the customer service has not been great.

The pizza was also OK, would have liked more topping and less sauce to go with it.  They have a nice selection of brews though, I had a blue-moon like smaller name deal.  The service was alright - I don't mind the no-nonsense, tough, but sort of friendly attitude, although my friends didn't appreciate it. 2009-11-08 21:23:24 1.0\n",

I wanted it to be someplace I frequented way more than I'd like to count and really needed to be noticed for such.

They would let me sit in the waiting room until I passed out or faked death, check on me once I made it to the ER, fix IVs, and sometimes bring me stuff to stay preoccupied with while I waited for a horrid prognosis (yea, I know I can be a bit dramatic, but just keep reading!). So yay for average bed side manner and medical professionals and staff that do their job! I've visited others here before and saw a bit of how the non-ER hospitalites lived.

      " yn0JEXGWxtO6n5uJ6JGz9w My husband grew up in Kerala, so we're always lookin' to score some tasty South Indian bites. We found Karaikudi online and made the voyage based upon the promise of nandu masala (crab curry), one of our favorites. When we arrived, we found the restaurant to be actually quite far on the outskirts of Toronto. It is in kind of a weird, largely unoccupied shopping complex. When you go inside, you find that it feels a lot like a traditional South Indian restaurant. The buffet had lots of South Indian morsels, so we decided against the nandu masala that we'd planned on. Instead, we had chai, veda with sambar, Chicken 65, avial, shrimp fry, really nice dosa, payasam and several other curries. The service was inconsistent. The food was okay. I'll agree with Ray that it was solid. We just keep looking for South Indian food that is better than the foods we make at home, or that my mother-in-law prepares. The quest continues. At $9.99 per buffet, this was a lot of food for lunch. With a buffet waiting for diners, it is a shame that you must make multiple requests for dosa (served fresh, not on the buffet), water, and chai. Not sure what keeps the waiters so busy with the buffet going on. The dosa were really good and actually better than those served at Udupi Palace on Gerrard. 2010-07-23 14:16:20 1.0\n",

The proportion was half cold slaw and half hot pastrami (with melted cheese and dressing in between). I was expecting the proportion to be more like 2/3 pastrami and 1/3 cold slaw, with the pastrami over-flowing and hanging over the sandwich--but it wasn't.  Because of the proportion, the sandwich didn't scream out \"pastrami\" in my mouth. In addition, i felt like the meat was way under-seasoned, which made it seemed like i was eating any other sandwiches with lunch meat inside. In conclusion, the sandwich did not lived up to its name.The only aspect i liked about the sandwich was the hot and cold textures. I probably wouldn't come back for their Capastrami. If i want a good pastrami sandwich, I would go over to Towers Deli (@ Venetian) and get their \"New York Sky High.\" Boombb!!!\n",

      " psnhiXbpDzt50YlQS3tZTQ We have been to Sierra Gold several times over the past couple of years. The most recent visit was on this past Friday, during Happy Hour (which is always the happiest hour of a Friday!). I was happy to find out happy hour does not end until 7 pm at Sierra Gold (some places end too early!). To my understanding, in order to receive the half-priced drinks & appetizers, you must be a \"Beers & Bites\" card holder (which is free to enroll and provides other positive benefits too!). We ordered two rounds of drinks, one of which included their \"Prickly Pear\" beverage; the ingredients listed all sounded good enough to quench our thirst, but the end result was a little too \"thick\" for our liking and while the mixture was good, the consistency did not quench anything. We also ordered their popcorn chicken with twister fries (which are always fun!) and a thin pizza (which I believe was the only half-priced appetizer offered). So in conclusion (1) I believe they need to revisit their \"Prickly Pear\" recipe, and (2) they need to consider adding more half-priced appetizers to their happy hour menu, oh and (3) is it necessary to charge $0.50 for an extra sauce (for the popcorn chicken?). The waitress was attentive and the service was good, so we will probably return again and try their other menu options. 2011-06-04 17:29:19 1.0\n",

Either that, or provide a 2:1 ratio of rice paper to fixings so that we can half the Nem Nuong to make a neater looking roll.  The bean sprouts were showing bits of brown, which was kind of a turn off and I avoided using these in my wrap altogether.  We were also shorted on the rice paper as we had 6 sausages but only 5 sheets of rice paper.\n",

Brak loves a good burger, and being hungry at the time, I had to pull in and check it out.  I ordered some sort of double burger and fries.  It wasn't bad, but I wasn't terribly impressed either.  The burger patties were thin with some weird consistency that I can't even describe.  They were somewhat overcooked.  The bun & fixins were fine, and that helped somewhat.  The fries were super-thin and coated with some sort of thin coating of batter before frying, and while they were tasty enough, their thinness made them somewhat of a pain to dip in Heinz's finest and made for having to grab a bunch of them at a time to mow through them without taking forever.  I'll probably give Freddy's another go at some point, and maybe try something else on the menu.  This joint requires further study for a comprehensive conclusion.

They used Whiz which was good but the meat was a bit dry. The bun claimed to be authentic but it wasn't  The Steak didn't have that flavorful taste like from Pop's or Geri's. It was a decent Cheese Steak. The Chips were the clear winner. Made fresh and almost Kettle Style Crispy. Had Cookoo Seasoning which was awesome. It was addicting like crack.

      "Anyway, I ordered the garden tofu lunch special ($6) with chow mein noodles. I was given a hot and sloppy plate of noodles, tofu (3 large pieces), and veggies covered in lots of brown sauce. The vegetables were cooked nicely but I was not a fan of the sweet and salty flavors. My taste buds were like, no por favor, dude. I disliked the baby corn and water chestnuts that came with it. And that's something I don't get about fast Chinese food and probably never will. The noodles that came were a mountain of Medusa's hair extensions. They were greasy, slithery, and totally unappetizing. Had they lightened on the sauce; added more onions and cabbage; and not cooked them for too long, I would have eaten more of it. Steamed brown rice would have been a better option but they charge a dollar extra, which is a bunch of bullshit. Shouldn't fried rice and chow mein be charged extra because you're using extra man power and other ingredients?  Oh well. Other add-ons include an okay egg drop soup and an unnecessary bowl of fried wonton strips with dipping sauces. I didn't sample the latter but it was a sweet gesture. If China Tango Bistro wants to strive for a modern and chic like their décor, they must have food and service to match that, and China Tango Bistro sadly doesn't. 2012-05-30 20:56:48 1.0\n",

For appetizer we settled on the ghee dosa which is basically a crepe cooked in ghee (clarified butter) and served with 3 condiments for dipping. OMFG the dosa was sublime! It was extremely crispy and flaky. The dough had a great buttery taste from the ghee; I do not even want to know how many calories were in this thing. The accompanying condiments were all good (I was not a huge fan of the coconut sambal) but otherwise these were great to dip our crispy dosa in.

The biryani was also served with 2 condiments; I enjoyed the yogurt with onions as it really balanced out the spiciness of the biryani.  The butter chicken was a pleasant surprise too considering that it is not a south Indian dish. The chicken was served in boneless chunks which were quite large, the gravy was very creamy and not very spicy, this dish was very enjoyable. \n",

My other friend wanted to order the biryani also but asked the waiter if it contained nuts (he has a severe allergy) the waiter came back and said the biryani contained cashews. My friend and his girlfriend proceeded to say that they would just share a masala dosa and a side of kotthu roti. The waiter brought them their food but failed to mention that the kotthu roti also contained cashews. My friend luckily caught this within a couple of bites but it was too late, he already had a reaction and had to leave to go get medication. The waiter looked stunned when we told him what happened and said it was a miscommunication, we spoke to the manager and he gave my friend and his girlfriend their dinner for free.

The menu was varied but there wasn't much on it that was terribly interesting or unique. I tried the Sloppy Joseph, a more \"sophisticated\" version of a sloppy joe.

We tried their seafood paella which the server advised would take about 30 minutes to make.  It did take about 30 minutes.  We just ordered for 1 person, which ended up being perfect for 2.

If you come on a Friday night, be prepared for a 7 dollar cover - and pretty expensive drink prices overall.  The place was packed when we arrived around 10 but a few groups had left and we were able to grab a few tables in the middle of the room.  We tried to get a third table for our group, since there were 12 of us, but a worker came over and was actually really rude to several of us and said we didn't have enough people for 3 tables, that we needed four to a table...we had 12 people, 12 divided by 3 is 4 the last time I checked - it was honestly really silly, but if the guy was just friendly about it, it wouldn't have been an issue at all.  \n",

The tripe, I asked for extra crispy and it was but I don't think they clean out the tripe, so it is a little grainy, a little gross if you think about it but it is perfectly sanitary since it has been deep fried to a crisp except the inside is again grainy. Carne Asade taco was good, crisp and chewy, lacked a little flavor. The Al Pastor was so so, it taste just like chorizo seasoning, that is the second place that has happened so I don't know if it might be a regional thing. Coming from out of state, the Al pastor tacos I had before had seasoning but not like this though. They did give free chips if you eat in, They were okay, their drinks are not home made, just come from a dispenser like others. I would give it a lower score, but they were definitely better than some of the others. I would mostly likely never come back since nothing was worth coming back for. It is an okay taco place though if you are around the corner and needed a place to eat.

      " AmIc5kVhThDB95T14k0XvA The layout is neat and clean as you walk-in. They commited well to the retro diner decor theme and they also have flat screens and a bar for sports enthusiasts. We selected the booth seating area... to my surprise the seat cushion moved completely out of place. No problem, we just moved over one booth, right? Wrong! The entire seat cushion of the other booth was busted too, but it was a little more manageable- (you just can't move -at all- while seated). So finally the seating situation is under control, so I went to wash my hands for the meal. The bathroom was basically brand new with all the updated features, such as scented spray sensors- oddly it smelt overwhleming like piss! When I say piss, I mean farm piss smell. So I looked around briefly... it was the beginning of the night and everything appeared to be clean, and the bathroom had hardly been used- so there was clearly deeper issues causing the washroom to smell like a urinal abused by a group of farm animals with bad aim. Alright, so I got the hell out the washroom and concentrated on removing this urine incident from my nose. Reset... So I went for the full experience, which would be a burger and a shake. The shake (6$) was fantastic with pieces of fudge brownie at the bottom. I recommend sharing between 2 people- it is a meal in itself. Two burgers were chosen: the Sammy D and the Elvis, both on their classic Jukebox white bun (they are said to be \"home-baked\"-nice). I should mention that they ground their own quality beef, as well, which is thoughtful. My critique about the burgers: If I order a preconfigured burger that has warm caramelised onions or warm chili, don't put the cold tomato and raw ring of oinions in the burger, too! I would have liked more of what I payed for (carmelized onions and mushrooms then the other tag-along toppings). The burger is great, though! Tastes like a solid homemade burger. Ours were cooked medium, borderline medium rare, which I'm sure they weren't going for. They were really juicy. Curly fries were tasty and could've been better if they weren't so cold and overly crunchy (made it unplesant to eat a lot of pieces). The traditional coleslaw was good- tasted and looks like fresh coleslaw made in-house. I rate this resto two stars for overall dining experience, the burger 3.5 stars(could easily be 4 with better execution) and the chocolate shake a solid 4-5 stars. Within a 1km walking distance, you can choose burgers from: A&W, Wendy's, Five Guys or Madisons; therefore, the war for your burger buck IS ON in the 'burbs! So, if I was struck again with the taste for a burger in that area, what would I chose? Easy, Jukebox. Why? It's truly the only ALL fresh burger (from the bun to beef patty and toppings) you can buy. And I don't mind paying 12$ for \"a\" burger, because it's actually real food. BTW one burger is good for two kids or a coed couple. I would only order one burger next-time. And I probably won't eat-in. I would takeout and pass on the retro timecapsule (which is done well), but too-family-resto-ee for my sanity. For the record, this place is not trying to be Johnny Rockets, the shake and the burgers are much more fresh and of higher quality. And this place is not expensive for families- you just have to know how to order. Burgers and shakes are good for two-don't be shy- ask for an extra glass and a proper knife and portion your food- because this restaurant isn't looking after your wasteline.

Their \"new\" location (at Higley and Brown) is a building formerly occupied by an Arby's; they moved in just after Christmas 2011, and you would think the new facility would be pretty spiffy because they would take time to fix it up so cute.  Not so!  It still looks like a tired and shabby Arby's, all scuffed up and untidy and frankly not very clean.  So, ambiance is a maybe a 2.  Now, prices are most reasonable, so for value I give them a 4+ rating, as in this economy, you want them to be easy on your wallet.  But, on the down side, the quality of what you get for a really low price is not so good, so my rating there is 1 1/2.  I took one of my pork chops home, but in the end just threw it out as it was tough, like leather.  Wait staff was great, attentive, and right on with answers, so I give them a 4.  The one saving grace amongst all these mixed ratings is certainly their PIE.  That, for sure, is a solid 5 stars and makes up for their lesser ratings.  I had their apple pie, um mm.

      "My sister and I were in Medina visiting our cousins and we all had cravings for sushi and pad thai so they suggested House of Hunan.  I was surprised by how quaint yet modern with a more upscale feel the restaurant is.  The ambiance, however, doesn't really make up for the service.  Evidently you need to call way ahead of time to make a reservation otherwise they look at you like you are out of your mind that you might want to eat there.  After waiting over thirty minutes for a table, we were finally seated at one of the large booths near the water fountainy thing in the middle of the restaurant.  We ended up needing to bring one of my cousin's kiddos with us due to dad having a late running golf outing... I do not recommend this as House of Hunan is not kid friendly in the least.  The manager actually came over once to let us know that \"the water has an awful lot of chemicals in it\" when he noticed the kids sitting next to the fountain and one of them had stuck a finger in the stream of water (aka \"Tell your kid to get his fingers out of the stupid water fountain.\").  There is no children's menu and they do not serve child size portions.  Service started out decent but after the food was served it was hard to find the waitress for refills and such.  As far as food, everything was pretty tasty.  We had a variety of plates overflowing the table.  Several different sushi rolls (everyone really liked the Key West), edamamme (can't really jack that up), salads, tofu pad thai, lo mein, some kind of green beans, and chicken and broccoli.  Beware that they charge you for rice with the entree meals.  She asked if we wanted fried or white with the chicken and broccoli so you would think it was included but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I guess that they have some kind of signature dessert that consists of a cheesecake layer with chocolate cake and chocolate mousse which sounded delicious.  However, they had already sold out of it.  Overall, a decent meal but make a reservation and leave the kids at home. 2013-08-18 22:09:41 1.0\n",

      "We had the dolmas, hummus and babaghanoush; so to be fair, that's what my review concerns.  I can't speak for any of the meat dishes, but while the hummus and babaghanoush are very good, my partner and I are in disagreement as to HOW good.  We both find the hummus to be better than at Haji Baba, a staple and favorite of ours in Tempe.  The hummus at Haji's is smoother; this one, more grainy.  You would think smoother would be better ... while it's a matter of taste, I would argue it isn't.  The grainier one leads me to believe it's most likely \"homemade\", while the smooth indicates mass-production.  Not saying that's the case for either; but having tried canned hummus, I suspect, I'm not wrong.  The babaghanoush here is of the same consistency as at Haji Baba's, but has a \"smokier\" texture.  As far as those two dishes go, we rate them hands down better than Haji Baba (though I think not by much; my partner thinks they're significantly better).  The dolmas ... meh.  Tastes like they're out of a can, whereas Haji Baba's is very distinct and \"non-traditional\".  \n",

There is NO separation -- except for a steel railing --- and as you eat, customers mill around the store.  It does not leave an impression or quiet, calm and privacy.  If ambiance is important to you, then this is most likely not the place to think about having a \"real\" meal.  On the other hand, the service at the food counter is friendly and quick.\n",
