And was distinctly underwhelmed. \\n\\nI was surprised by the variety of the menu, though- in addition to iced and hot coffee drinks, the menu includes the namesake donuts, and various breakfast sandwiches. They have an order of oatmeal available as their lone healthy option.\\n\\nThis location does have a drive-thru, which is convenient. Service was a bit spotty, which is to be expected as they are new. Prices are on par with other coffee chains. Avoid the latte lites, which are straight-up aspartame.\",\n",

I understand they are new and probably trying to work the kinks out, but ten minutes to order an iced latte seems really excessive. On top of that, the latte I ordered had no flavor to it. I hope they improve their drive-thru time and drinks as this place is easily accessible and usually delicious!',\n",
    "#   'Went here 4 days in a row around 8:30 AM.\\n\\nDay 1: Ordered the #1 (2 donuts & a coffee) & the lady manager rings up my debit card & hands it back to me. Asks me what donuts I want all the while chatting/splitting her attention w/ the old guy that looks like he is a regular, daily customer.\\n\\nI finally get a chance to tell her & she tells me the ones I want are 40 cents extra each. I don\\'t mind paying extra but she should have let me tell her what I wanted before swiping my card & handing it back to me. (The two donuts at 40 cents extra equals the total price of the #1 as stated on the menu so I\\'m not really paying \"extra\" rather saving 80 cents if I get 2 regular donuts)\\n\\nDay 2: Ordered the #1 again. Girl at counter asks the guy manager if all the donuts costs the same for the #1 & he says yes. I am happy with my donuts, coffee, & the service so I order 50 donut holes to go for my coworkers.\\n\\nDay 3: Ordered the #1 again but went through the drive thru this time. The guy says he is the seasoned manager & asks me what I would like on my \"ICED\" coffee. I told him I would like 8 Splendas (2 per every 8 ounces plus an extra 1-2 due to the ice)... When I get to the window, he hands me s \"HOT\" coffee (16 oz) & I am already late to work so I just take it & leave. Putting 8 Splendas in 16 oz of hot coffee makes it way too sweet. The coffee sizes differ based on hot or cold (ie: a medium hot coffee is 16 oz while a medium cold iced coffee is 24 oz)\\n\\nDay 4: Decide to give this place one last chance. I order the #1 again & the young girl at the counter asks her manager if all the donuts are the same price to which he tells her that some are 40 cents extra. I had to repeat myself about what I wanted in my coffee but she looked stressed out so I just gave her a break.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my coffee, the two senior citizens in front of me were complaining about their coffee to the manager. The young girl left the register to help with the coffee for the different customers & mixed up some of them. After finally getting my coffe, I left.\\n\\nAll in all, donuts tasted great but their communication & service needs some work. I would still visit this location again but I would make sure to be extremely specific so they do not mess up anything.'],\n",

After passing by this place at least 10 times a week, I finally saw the open sign lit on Tuesday. Since I was busy yesterday, I decided to wait until tonight to eat here. For 9pm, this place was ridiculously busy. However I assume it was full of people who wanted to try this place for the first time, so I'm not expecting the full seated load to last. \\n\\nThe menu here is very extensive. There was your typical HK style cafe options, as well as dim sum. There are two featured items on the menu which are also advertised outside the restaurant along the wall facing Highway 7. I decided to try one of them, which was the Shanghai style beef noodle soup (forgot the exact term).\\n\\nAs we were waiting for our food, one of the employees gave us two 10% off cards, which are valid until January 31, 2015. The meal itself was also 10% off for their grand opening special.\\n\\nThe food took a good 15-20 minutes to come, however the iced lemon and iced milk teas both came rather quick. The milk tea here seems to be better than the lemon tea, as my dad found the milk tea to be good and I found the lemon tea to be mediocre. As for the noodle soup...it was also mediocre. Edible at least, but definitely not what I would say memorable.\\n\\nThere are a lot of other items in the menu that could be worth trying, but I'm gonna wait for other Yelpers to review this restaurant before considering coming back.\",\n",
    "#   \"So what does the newly opened Kitchen M offer up?\\nThe short answer - its a Hong Kong style cafe\\nIt was pretty busy on a Thursday afternoon but I'm guessing its because people are curious to find out what they serve here just like me. Service was blazing fast and we got our food within 5 minutes at the most from ordering. \\n\\nGrouper with spaghetti noodles and cream sauce $10.95 - includes vegetable soup and choice of HK style milk tea or coffee. Everything tasted good but nothing that will WOW you. Also, portions were huge so come on an empty stomach.\\n\\nMalaysian curry and chicken with rice $11.95 - once again includes vegetable soup and choice of hot drink. Found that the chicken was a bit tough and once again portions were huge.\\n\\nOn the back of the menu there is a build your noodle section so you can choose the type of noodles and select two meats to be added. Surprisingly you can't choose the type of soup. It was just your standard chicken broth type of soup. Went with the vermicelli noodles with pig intestine and fish skin, plus you also get a hot drink with it for $8.45. The portions were once again very large and the meal was good but nothing really memorable.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a quick meal that is cheap and filling then this is the place for you.\",\n",

It's ok. 3.5 stars. \\n\\nMilk tea is actually quite decent.\"],\n",

Pretty good location and at least for the duration I was there (weekday), the crowd was a mixed crowd with young and old.  They have nice booths and tables you can sit at and if you can get a table or a booth, it's a great place to people watch, either at the people in the bar or people out at the casino floors.  Vegas never fails to produce some interesting people haha.\\n\\nBartenders here are great.  Talkative, nice, and make fairly strong drinks.  Prices are average for Vegas, which is nothing to be surprised about.  They have about 5 beers on tap with a nice selection for the bottles.  One bartender even gave us a beer each on the house even though we've only been sitting there chilling with our beer.  Needless to say we gave him a nice tip in the end.  \\n\\nOne fun thing is that when certain songs are played, all the bartenders and wait staff will get up on the bar table and dance.  Even though they aren't that great, it's entertaining nonetheless!\\n\\nThis place is pretty ideal on a weekday to chill after work, and I'm sure on the weekends it can be much more packed.\"]]\n",
