If you sit here, people walking by our restaurant may think it is full and would not come in.\"  I looked around and there were at least 3 empty tables and no waiting customers.  I told her if there are customers waiting for the seats, I'd gladly wait outside.  So I stay put.  Moments later, a Caucasian customer walked in.  She seated him next to me and said: \"There is customer now.  You have to wait outside.\"   WTF!  I then told her I am also a customer too.  If I have to wait outside, then they can change my take-out order to dine in instead.  I told the gentleman sitting next to me about what's happening and asked if he mind I stay seated for another 5 minutes. He had no objection at all.  Then I told the waitress I already asked their customer and he doesn't mind me sitting with him.  At the end , they gave me my lunch and I left.

She was very sassy and had no patience for her customers. My grandma was trying to order a skinny cinnamon dolce latte with no added sugar and non fat milk. Instead of saying \"ok\", she basically yelled at us saying that that isn't possible and the sugar is the cinnamon dolce. We understood that, but we didn't want added stevia or anything else. Also and when I asked for a drink, that was on the menu, she said that they don't make that and that she didn't know what it was. It was clearly on the menu so I would assume they'd know what it was. Anyways, all and all, the customers service was horrible. Luckily the guy who made our drinks did them right and they tasted great.

At this point I have been waiting with consideration and thinking... well.. they must be busy and will be coming over soon. But when I see the couple getting side dishes and being served their food I just got up and left.

We had a new waitress yesterday who was sweet and adorable, Ashley? I think was her name. Pumpkin pancakes and potato pancakes were delicious. Everything was good and I would have given 5 stars EXCEPT The horrible blonde hostess woman who seemed to get pleasure by being rude to customers as they were paying and leaving. She is awful. She is outwardly rude to customers and seems to gain pleasure by being so....we left a 30% cash tip for our waitress the other day...she thought it was her place to advise me that I was \" required\" to tip on my credit card at minimum of 15%...not her place to tell me how much or that a tip was required. A tip is a courtesy, not a requirement. We always tip at minimum 20 to 30% depending on service, so her advice would have cost our wonderful server. The hostess needs to learn customer service, basic kindness, general politeness if that is possible. She took a 5 star experience and dropped it to a 3...had our service been off or the food not as good, she could have lost you good customers. TRAIN HER..PLEASE! the next time I hear her being rude or condescending to myself or another customer, I promise I will be calling her out on her rudeness and to management. She is a major detriment to your business.  To other customers, be aware that the awful hostess woman will be rude, will tell you how to tip and will make snide comments about you ...but the food is good and most of the waitstaff is good...so ignore the crabby hostess, she has a lot of bad days, and enjoy your breakfast or lunch. 2016-09-08 01:15:34 3.5416307\n",

Instead what I was told was how large groups aren't of value to them as they don't make as much money and that they are in the business of flipping tables and doing volume so don't care about groups and don't even want groups! This was said to a customer!!?!! Any owner that basically says to their customer that they aren't as valuable as they  are only focused on making as much money as possible makes me seriously question how they run the rest of their business. Perhaps the owner forgot that the key to have the large group as repeat business is to give fantastic customer service. So if you don't want to support a business that treats their customers like they are just numbers, then join me in boycotting this establishment. Luckily their competition right in the same plaza was happy to take our business and equally appalled at how we were treated:) 2016-03-26 22:34:26 3.5187435\n",

      " JAM7lPfSj9OgutWvely2TA Date night at SG was a hit.  First we went to the Jones location and the customer service was terrible so we drove to Henderson.  Most locals think it's far, but actually not a bad drive at all.  The customer service was great.  We sat at the bar and played some games.  Our money got stuck and the bar tender quickly called a repair guy who came and opened the machine and gave us our money and we continued playing.   Now on to the food.... can I say sooooooo delicious! The portions were big well at least to me so I didn't finish it all and I was sharing with my husband.  The drinks were made to perfection and the other locals at the bar were very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday and they bought him a Yeager and redbull.  He is not a big drinker, but he enjoyed the drink. All around 5 stars for customer service, location, and the other customers.  We went on my husband's birthday which was Feb. 22 and I must say we will be returning.  We live in summerlin, but we enjoy this location the most. 2016-03-03 20:41:03 3.5187435\n",

I have always changed my own oil and on rare occasion,  have had to take my vehicle to a shop to have the oil plug loosened,  always free of charge.  I decided to stop by Meineke today after having some tires changed next door.  This particular Meineke was dead with only one ore two cars being worked on.  I went to the gentleman at the counter to ask if they could loosen the plug,  at which point the shop manager,  who was lazily lounging in one of the customer chairs in the lobby piped up and said \"No, I don't usually do that\".  Well I don't usually pay people who laze around in the customer waiting area to change the oil on my car either.  I stopped by Jiffy Lube,  who had plenty of customers,  and they loosened my oil plug with no nonsense and no charge.  Good luck Meineke!  Maybe you will help the next person who comes in and asks for a small and simple favor.  That person however will never again be me. 2017-10-29 00:12:28 3.5187435\n",

However, once my promotional deal ended I was paying double. I called and spoke to a very kind customer service representative, but she was unable to lower my bill because I was not a new customer. All of the promotions are for new customers only. Annoying. I canceled my service and switched providers which cut my bill in half. After paying what I thought was my last and final CenturyLink bill I received another bill! Disconnection fees. What a rip off! And I returned my rented equipment myself to the CenturyLink store.

      "In all my years I have never seen a restaurant this poorly ran. I entered the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. There were no other customers in the establishment however there were at least 10 employees standing around talking. The staff acted as if we were not there they were either on cell phones making person calls or screaming at each other from opposite ends of the store. The supervisor appeared to be all of 18 years old and decided to re-tuck his uniform in requiring him to unbuttoned his pants and showcase his underwear in the middle of the dining room floor. After about 40 mins. a couple with their child entered the parking lot the supervisor said \"Let's tell them we're out of waffles\" and the entire staff laughed. This was a disgusting act of customer service, corporate really needs to look into closing this location they,are over staffed without any customers. 2016-06-22 10:37:22 3.3873286\n",

As a Professor in interrelations, I have to say that I know professionalism of a successful company, than a company that is full of risk. I was billed two bills from the CenturyLink company in which I do not have service with.  Contacting CenturyLink customer service was like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. \n",
      "\n",
      "      This company uses automative phone services responses, when a company uses automative phone response technology this is a \"red flag warning\". Companies that mostly use this technology avoid interactions of customer service complaints and they do not want to solve complaints that pertain to financial matters. It took me 35 minutes to get pass the automative responses.  When I reached the first representative I explained my situation to him and his attitude was unpleasant when I told him about the financial mistake.   \n",
      "\n",
      "     So this representative solved one problem of one of the bills and said that he had to pass me over to the \"retention department\" now, I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes as I was relayed to 7 different representatives that told me that they had to forward me over to the right department, when I finally reached someone and explained my situation to them for the 8th time, this person apologized to me for all of the problems that I had went through and solved the problem, I want to thank Nicki for her kindness.  \n",
      "\n",
      "     As a professional in interrelations and a scholar, I am very disappointed in this company that interacts with customers through networking. My evaluation of this company is 0% I only acknowledge the one representative Nicki.  In the reviewing of the present post of complaints it is to be made aware that this company has a negative impression on customer service and the community and is to be avoided as an internet and service provider. This company has leadership and managerial problems in which is demonstrated through the action of their employees. \n",
      "\n",
      "     I recommend that CenturyLinks senior representatives and stakeholders sit down at the table and start with a new management risk plan, because the actions that are displayed are a risk to the customers of taking a chance of putting their finances and trust in a company that does not deliver on their products and services and make grave mistakes. I recommend that consumers use internet and service providers that are competent and that have good relations with their customers such as Dish network or Cox.  Consumers should avoid services with CenturyLink until their customer satisfaction has improved and that they have demonstrated organizational professionalism.\n",

The workers ignored us and yelled at us from the back asking what we needed. They took no care to wax properly. My sister had to return to get a second wax in order to \"fix\" the issues with the first wax. The spoke in another language the entire time and took no opportunity to greet us at all. They refused credit card as a form of payment and only accepted cash. I would not recommend this place and will never go back. Be warned. 2016-08-31 02:39:51 3.2950506\n",

This location really struggles with its customer service. Seems like everytime I come here there is only a couple waitresses and they're not really on point with getting her order, refilling your coffee or virtually any aspect of the job. When the food does come out usually it is accurate but it's just the terrible customer service you have to deal with if you want to come to this location.

      " b6bO-FJm7nAVKgAvJvB1zQ Went in for Dinner with my Girlfriend and her Mom on Saturday night. We were the only table dining-in so I was a little bit leary but it was still early (5pm) and we were all hungry. After about 20 minutes anotherly elderly couple came to dine-in. So only 2 tables going in the entire place. I must admit the food was good, very fresh ingriedients and nicely presented. HOWEVER the dam waitress wouldn't stop texting on her cell phone the entire time in the dining room in plain view of the  5 customers that were in there. So we were sitting there with empty glasses and could not get our drinks refilled and when we did manage to finally get her attention she seemed pissed and discombobulated that we interupted her Texting session. When trying to get the check we actually had to go up front to the manager cause miss Texty wouldnt look up from her phone. Ironically the Manager was sitting up front on her laptop searching for Christmas sale items. I was always under the impression that the Customer was supposed to be #1 not the Cell Phone/Computer. So if you want to go and recieve awful service from a 16 year old waitress texting while she's supposed to be servicing customers this is the place to go. I only gave 2 stars cause the food was actually pretty decent. We will never return due to the EXTREME lack of customer service knowledge on managements part and front line staff. 2012-11-26 23:44:36 3.2555804\n",

Today I really had worse experience I don't think I will ever want to go again. The rates which are displayed are not the same what they billed. The staff who take the order will not bother about the customer service anymore. since they are huge lineups for the food they don't  need to be attentive. Today I have ordered 2 dishes 1 dish for dine in and 1 for take out and the clerk made both take out. When I asked her to make 1 dine in, just gave the parcel boxes in a tray. There were no spoons or knives to eat. They made me to wait for a while to get the cutlery. By the time I started eating the food was already very cold. I had similar kind of experience last time also. I don't think if the management is not talking care of this things soon they will lose loyal customers like me. They will not have line ups anymore. 2017-07-03 03:29:49 3.2523506\n",

Again delivery on time and helpful but when they went to install the stove the guys found it very damaged. I was assured it would be replaced. What I found strange was I never hear from the store. So got my stove and now another thing wrong a piece missing on the dishwasher. This time we have to order a part after not even having the product for 30 days.  Again no call from store. I am a little surprise that the store does not make a point to call customers when something goes wrong.  I guess once you walk out the store the customer service ends.

I drove 3 mins to meineke and stood in line.

He said no we can't do your oil change today that's not how it works and proceeded to lecture me in front of other customers about booking appt online and how your system operates. I wanted to tell him that online your appointment system is very vague and DOES NOT say how long you will need my car but instead I told him to cancel everything and walked out. I suggest that you train him better with how to talk professional to customers or else you will lose business. 4 people in line behind me walked out and talked to me about how rude this guy was. the GM of this company needs to be aware of his professionalism while at work! 2017-09-21 18:12:32 3.161017\n",

Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!\n",

The lighting was well done so the technicians have light to see, but is not overly bright for customers. Relaxing music is piped through the salon at an appropriate level to be heard, but not infringe on conversation. The nail bar is separated from the pedicure stations by a partial wall that includes a water fixture (faux fish tank). We were greeted very warmly upon arrival and offered a choice of complimentary water or wine. Other customers in the area appeared very relaxed, and the general feel of the employees was warm and inviting. \n",

The seats are comfortable even without using the massage options.

The technicians make sure you are aware of their sanitary practices. \n",

The service included removing old polish, cuticle treatment and removal, clipping and filing toenails, pumice and callous remover for feet, parrafin treatment, foot, ankle, and lower leg massage with lotion, and paintedtoenails. All this cost $35 dollars, which is a great deal! \n",

I found a white plastic-like piece of something in my dosa which I spent about good five minutes experimenting with my guest to see whether it was harmful or not. While I concluded that it was most probably ok to finish eating the food and that what I found is something that is not non-veg (as i'm a vegetarian!), I was still disturbed by the experience. Consequently, I called the waitress and informed about it. She took the white plastic-like object from me and had a discussion with the mangers and owner right in front of me (everyone made eye contact and/or starred at me while having a discussion, lol!). Waitress came back and said that I could have gotten another dosa but since I finished eating what I ordered i'm no longer eligible AND  that it won't be taken off the bill bc they are already doing their anniversary promotion and so they cannot offer another discount. I was really upset because a) this whole thing interrupted my dinner, b) interrupted my dinner date with my guest, c) caused a lot of stress d) wasted a whole lot of my time, e) and to make matters worse they offered me a deal which apparently had expired because I continued to eat the dosa - this is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from a restaurant manager!! and I was extremely shocked to hear it come from a restaurant that charges a hefty price!\n",
      "\n",
      "I went straight to the owner, David, and brought up the issue. He repeated just what the waitress had told me which is that since I finished the food, they cannot offer me anything. I told him how much i'm disappointed and upset by their customer service. I raised all of the above points as well as the fact that all complaints should be handled directly by the manager and the least that could've been done is give an apology instead of arguing with the customer with a ridiculous point!! What was evident from the conversation is that the managers and especially the owner have no customer service skills and they have no interest in looking after customer satisfaction. David was simply using a cookie-cutter approach to the problem instead of looking at it in an individual basis and focusing on customer satisfaction. He said that his team of staff figured out that the white plastic-like object was in fact a piece of flattened dry rice. What they failed to do is inform that to me so that at least it would have put me at ease instead leaving me to feel that i could've potentially eaten something harmful. What was really interesting in the conversation with David is that no where in our conversation he took the ownership for their mistake which includes but not limited to: a) sending a waitress to address complaint instead of  a manger, b) not informing that the object is in fact rice and not something harmful, c) not offering apology, d) offering a deal that apparently expired because i finished eating the last bit of dosa i had in my plate, e) telling me that because they were doing a promotion for their anniversary, they cannot offer another discount for me (which was a very foolish thing to say!).. etc. \n",

Located in the ever changing and gentrifing East Liberty, this new spot offers diners unmatched customization via kiosk (or mobile app) of MTO stir fry, salads, fruit cups (aka honeybars) and cold-pressed juices. I appreciate the level of detail that went into the touch screen menu, which made meal customization more transparent and easy to accomplish. However, less tech savvy folks may find themselves a bit overwhelmed and the overall user experience cumbersome -- if one of the kiosks is down, it can take awhile to order during peak times. Nonetheless, the wait time during this visit was reasonable. More importantly, the food was delicious! Fresh, quality ingredients simply taste better. Your palate will thank you, but your wallet may not depending on how custom you made your meal. I was also delighted to see non-Coke/non-Pepsi products available at the fountain...Maine Root FTW! The sleek, minimalistic interior design was open, bright and inviting though a little more seating wouldn't be a bad idea. And a friendly staff is always a welcome change.

Not only was I not informed at the time of account cancellation that I was going to be charged full price for my services as I lost my discount when I didn't have the account for a full month, but am being charged two extra days at a prorated full price of services I did not use. I spoke to a representative weeks before and was told I could opt to have my account cancelled when I returned my equipment. Not only was that not true, but I was not able to reach anyone through the phone number given to me by the store clerk that day and had to call the next morning. Then, I was informed it takes 24 hours for it to be cancelled, having them charge me an extra day of services I was obviously not using as I had already returned my equipment. So now, because of incorrect information provided to me, I am being charged these extra two days because of Century Link's incompetence. After being a loyal customer for over 2 years, I am shocked to be treated in such a manner. With them not \"believing\" me that I tried calling the day I returned my equipment and not being able to \"prove\" that I did not use the service those extra days (without my equipment and as I drove across the country, no less), they can't bother to credit me for those days. Must be nice that I was enrolled in autopay and they could just debit that automatically from my account, right? Did I mention I would've kept my services if they were available in my new state? I wouldn't return to Century Link as a customer knowing how they value loyal customers even I had the option again. \n",

      "First issue:  The worlds most condescending finance manager.  I have never, in all my years, been spoken to with such utter disrespect.  I barely said a word throughout the process and yet I was spoken to as though I couldn't even get the name portion correct on an IQ test.  They acted as though I could not comprehend simple words and phrases despite my prompt and polite responses.  By the time I was done with this prick (overweight, 50's, mustache, shit eating grin) I came close to just tearing up the contract and punching him in the face.  Why on god's green earth you'd want to treat a paying customer like that I have no idea, and I really don't care - there is NO excuse for it.  I cannot believe this person hasn't been fired yet, as I assume he speaks to other customers in this same manner, not to mention subordinates, colleagues, co-workers, etc.  If you're upper management and you're reading this, don't take my word for it, listen in on the next few people who come in and see the kind of customer service your customers are getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second issue:  Everything about the process was dishonest, from the sham \"High Tech\" warranty that covers exactly nothing, to the internet discount, the fees, the quality and stability of the car (I've had to take it in to an actually REPUTABLE auto shop 3 times for various issues), to the finance company that puts so many road blocks in your way for issues you have that you will NEVER get your issues resolved.  EVER.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line - NEVER purchase or finance a car from these people, they will absolutely screw you over and will not even attempt to fix it.  These people need to be investigated for FRAUD. 2013-08-23 23:20:08 2.9874654\n",

      "1. Take-out charge (50 cents)- although this is not much, I've never heard of a place that charges something that is part of their business expense!  No other restaurant charges this type of fee for something customers can't finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Does not accept credit card- only debit cards and cash.  However,  as I was going to pay with debit the machine wants to charge me a surcharge for using debit???!!!!  It's bad enough that they don't take credit cards and don't even tell customers in advanced but to charge customers for using debit card as well??  Here is another example of a business who indirectly just wants cash.  Probably reports only a portion of their earnings to CRA.  Honestly, I have never been to ANY restaurants that have this type of money-grabbing business practice as a way to boost their revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Food- good but nothing to die for especially when they charge prices that are more than other places I've been to.  I ordered to Roti Curry, Curry chicken and Chicken Vermicelli.  Vermicelli isn't really authentic.  They used the 'Gui Lin' noodles instead of the true rice noodle (mei-fun) that most other places use and the chicken portion is very small. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Service- average.  It is a typical Chinese business who thinks that just because they are getting business they can treat their customers badly.\n",

The tech that greeted me stated he would check the wait time. I didn't understand the conversation between him and an older lady but he turned and asked did I want gel or regular full set. I replied regular. All of a sudden \"they were busy\" and couldn't fit me in. I asked within the next 3.5 hours that they're open, there's no availability? I wasn't planning on coming back or staying but I was just blown away by the blatant unprofessionalism and poor customer service. He stated maybe come back tomorrow. So goes without saying, I will never step foot or refer anyone there again. They were convenient but did subpar work consistently. Found a much better shop up the way.

I can't say enough about them. The most recent fix was a reconditioning of my headlights, which were so hazy that another body shop didn't even want to work on them. The other alternative would have been new headlight assemblies, and at 1800 installed, the service that TJ and Randy performed was worth twice that, and the cost significantly less. 2014-04-07 17:50:45 2.9793203\n",

If you're looking for a salad, I'd suggest going to hello bistro instead; the ambiance might not be as great, but you have more topping options and get more salad for your money, and it tastes better too. The salads and the stir fry here are pretty good, but I just can't get over the fact that they don't put prices for their non-custom menu items.

Then after I left I stopped at a store checked the hatch area and they didn't even clean / vacuum it.  Spend between $30-$50 every two weeks. Just lost a long time customer due to lies, inappropriate practices and lack of customer service.

The one thing the last time I was there there that was rather annoying especially since it was my birthday was that both my husband and I wasted avocado on our bowls and they did not have anymore prepared on Friday night ready for customer and we would have had to wait 10 minutes which lets be be for real by the size of the container it would have been longer then 10 minutes which goes back to why are you not top of your food prep when all your food is RAW!  Still love the poke though.  I just prepare myself that they will not have all the yummy stuff I love and when they do it's a bonus.  But to be truly honest the only issue I have ever had was the avocado and they had it it was just not prepared. The fish is always fresh!!!! 2017-09-10 18:35:26 2.8999288\n",

When I called them to rectify the situation they were not helpful at all, acted as though they couldn't care less. The owner was horrible to me! After feeling mocked over the phone I told her I'd call her back and when I did, no one picked up. When the customer service rep at just-eat also tried to contact them they didn't pick up. Now onto the food: one of the special rolls I ordered had TWO pieces. Such a rip-off. The seafood udon had bland, overcooked pieces of fish and shrimp that they had clearly just thrown in with the same amount of carelessness they display in their customer service. The chilled tofu was bland and drenched in a ton of sesame oil. I would NOT recommend this place. 2017-11-13 02:40:45 2.8999288\n",

And it is impossible to get any help by phone. If you email or chat they tell you that you need to call in. I canceled my service and was told that I would be receiving boxes to return there equipment in and after waiting 2 weeks I called in which took 2 days to get to some one to talk to. Only to be told that since my account was closed they could not help me and oh by the way the boxes were never sent out. I asked for a manager and was told there was no managers. Wow. When I asked what I was suppose to do with their equipment they told me to take it to a Centurylink store. Too bad they didn't offer that to me when I canceled. The customer service is the worst that I have seen. I hope they treat their employees better than their customers but by the looks of the store I went to to return it is doubtful. 2015-06-24 18:28:15 2.8246589\n",

      " gaiUUz-Mwsfgso6DO7gyMg I received a rebate back last week from the Discount Tire Black Friday deal. I have been a customer for America's Tire Company/Discount Tire for many years and have bought a number of set of tires. So when I saw they had a deal for Black Friday 2015, I was excited to get a deal. The rebate is one that I had to email in and ran into some delays, however I received a rebate check. While their add seemed to imply a $100 rebate for best quality tires or $75 for better rated tires, my rebate check was for $50. That is less than 10% of what I paid. The tires are good and the customer service was good but I am disappointed with such a low rebate for a Black Friday deal especially when competitors were offering buy 3 get one free. Moral learned from my story, if you see what looks like a deal, make sure to shop around if price is matters to you. 2016-03-13 04:38:29 2.8246589\n",

I think this is an OWNERSHIP issue and not wait staff.    The reason I say this is because they don't assign just ONE person to your table but rather serve you as a group.   Thus no single person seemed to have responsibility for the table.   Perhaps a better approach to management and opportunity for each wait staff to take personal ownership for their customers will result in competition and increased incentive to please customers, earn tips, and garner repeat business for the establishment.     If they insist on waiting on customers as a group then the MANAGER of the group needs to motivate, coach, and develop the team better.

He said he would take care of it, i watched him put chemicals into the pool and within 24 hours our pool was dark swampy green. Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until Monday AFTERNOON to take a look at our pool that their person turned green.

Not even a week later, one of the batteries that I paid a good amount for stopped working. and within 2 months, so did the second battery I bought :(  Also while I was there, I observed some remarks made by employees that I felt were inappropriate. I witnessed some employees making fun of customers and laughing. A young lady said \"I only offer the needle tip ejuice to people I like. If I don't like them, I don't offer it to them\" and she laughed. Also they seemed to be so involved with personal conversations, customers are getting neglected.

      " UThJrPyesQ32PDQDeKxTow I am happy, once again, to be a Discount Tire customer.  I am traveling home from a long road trip with 1200 more miles to go when I realized my tires were done for.  I came to this Discount Tire at the recommendation of my brother in law, who lives nearby.  I am so grateful he did!  The staff are courteous and friendly.  Eric is the best!  He not only quickly got the ball rolling, but gave me a discount equal to the rebate I could have gotten.  Since I am terrible about sending in for my rebates, this is extra special.  In addition to that, he referred me to a local shop for my alignment and oil change.  He called ahead to make sure they had the equipment needed for my old Odyssey and let them know I was coming once my tires are on.  I am so impressed.  Many businesses could learn from the customer service and just plain kindness shown me here today.  As a mom traveling alone with her kids, this kind of care by strangers makes all the difference. 2015-08-13 19:43:46 2.6852622\n",

      " rZixO1iHS3F5S1ZBL1blOw I am extremely disappointed with the customer service!!!! After a stressful blow out on the 202 freeway, my first instincts was to call Discount Tire for a replacement, since I had purchased tires from them twice before. I was quoted one price over the phone, which had convinced me to drive down to the shop on my donut. When I arrived I was told that the total price was going to be an additional $50, not including the warranty. Not only was I floored at the increase in price, but I was also told by Joey that I needed to replace another tire ASAP, since the tread was at a 4. I walked outside and started to shop around to other local businesses. I did end up going elsewhere, where they charged me the actual price quoted, which was in turn cheaper than Discount. In addition, the competitor informed me that the thread on my other three tires were just fine, none were even close to a 4, but instead all an 8. I will not be returning due to the dishonesty when I was in a vulnerable state. Big O Tires surpassed your customer service 100%! 2017-01-23 16:25:16 2.6852622\n",

      " KYtNjvTJM340kV8qRtD1_w Update to my previous review which was originally five stars. My wife and I went in to Poki Point today around 11:50AM. Apparently they don't open until 12:00.  Door probably should have been locked until that time. No one greeted us, and I had to ask if they were open.  The young girl working told us they weren't open until 12. That was it.  No welcome and/or have a seat and we will serve you when everything is ready.  We almost left because of the response or lack of, but chose to wait since this is one of our favorite poke restaurants. Time passed and shortly after 12 another customer walked in and began ordering. What?  We were sitting down the whole time, and not one employee let us know they were ready for us to order. We were both extremely disappointed and left. With so many poke restaurants popping up all over the area, this one needs to improve on their customer service. We will probably give them another try. Everyone has a bad day, but if the service is the same, we will be on to somewhere else. 2018-07-08 19:32:22 2.6852622\n",

      " eFZWJJHiCg8TnXN7zoEDiQ I'll start by saying that I stopped in here because it's close to my home and I was completely out of Ejuice.  I needed something to get me through until my next big online purchase.  This review is based on the customer service I received.\n",
      "I was greeted by a nice young man, who showed me to the \"tasting table\".  I was then promptly left alone for my entire visit, and not helped again until I made my purchase at the register.\n",
      "I understand that many people simply want to be left alone to look around in a store and not hassled by employees.  I totally understand that.  However, there is a difference between making sure your customers are taken care of (whether they want to be left alone or not), and completely ignoring them.  That's how I felt when I was there; ignored.  I would have appreciated someone stopping by every now and then to see how I was doing, to see if I needed anything, to maybe ask me how I was finding their flavors.  Trust me I would have had a few questions for them.\n",
      "There were at least 5 employees during my visit, and maybe 5 customers.  Any one of the employees had every opportunity to check in on me, but didn't.  I understand that I could have gone up to any of them and asked a question, but they seemed so involved in their own conversations, it didn't feel very comfortable.  There's something to be said for acknowledging your customers, for shooting a smile or a nod their way, and for occasionally asking them if they're doing ok.\n",
      "When I found a juice I liked, I told one of the sales associates and they said all they had left was either 0% or 2.4mg nicotine.  I said I usually vape 1.2mg or 1.8mg, and he left to go fill the 0% with some nicotine.  He came back, rang it up at the register, and said it would be about $17.  I paused for a moment, as all I wanted was a $10 15ml bottle.  I wasn't informed of any specials, deals or discounts, and when I tried to check the Facebook page for a discount, the guy informed me that because it was not their own Ejuice that I couldn't use a discount anyway.  That would have been nice to know beforehand.  He didn't really offer me any options or try to engage me to try and see if there was something else I might be more interested in.  I felt inclined to make the purchase because he had already adjusted the nicotine level of the bottle.  I paid for the juice, walked out, and felt sort of bamboozled.\n",
      "Later at home I checked out their Facebook, web, and Yelp pages, and found all sorts of discounts, deals and check-ins.  On their Yelp page, for example, I saw \"Receive a Free 15ml E-Juice with Any $20 Purchase!\"  For an extra $3, I would have loved to get a free 15ml bottle of anything!  That would have been a very easy way to get $3 more out of me, and I would have happily paid it for a free bottle of juice.  I would have liked to have been informed of all these in the store, and at the very least told about how the frequent member card worked, what it was, how to sign up for it using the in-store tablet, and what it gives me.  He could have at least informed me that because the discounts don't work on this juice, I might want to try some more of their own mixes to get a better deal.  \n",
      "Having worked in retail, I saw so many customer servicing opportunities for a sales associate to offer me assistance, inform me on their products, up-sell me on an item, or even just ask how my day was going.  Nobody asked me if I currently vaped, if I knew how any of this stuff worked, if I was a current/former smoker, or if I was even looking for something in particular.  If I wanted a 0% level of customer service I could have just stayed home and made an online purchase where I got more for my money.  I feel like people go into brick-and-mortar stores instead of the Web exactly for that reason, to receive some customer service.  I'm happy with my vape, and that's fine, but if that's the level of service I can expect at Puff Vapors, I might not be inclined to go back.\n",
      "I'll say that I was really expecting a lot more.  I felt like I was in a self-serve shop, and that even upon my exit that I was more of a nuisance to be checked out real quick instead of engaged into learning more about their products and deals. 2013-10-14 01:03:43 2.6296082\n",

Making me and my boyfriend unable to get our car out of the lot for 5 minutes.

I only hope they can take customers reviews into consideration to help improve their business. Maybe instead of taking offense of my review, both the server and the owner could've asked the question, what can we do to make our customers experience more enjoyable?

I ordered my single burger California style, and it was pretty much a salad on a bun.  The \"burger\" was quite literally a whisper of meat that was so thin and crisply fried that I couldn't even taste it. It couldn't have been more than 2 ounces of meat. I left hungry after spending $8 on a combo. Not good Freddy! 2018-04-16 03:30:30 2.6080904\n",

I had recently popped my tire, so I was driving off of a donut. My wheels are after market and custom, so they needed to be special ordered. I called in and spoke to Joe, he instantly got me my tires the next morning(There were only 2 stores in Arizona that had them in stock.) Which was very quick because a different Discount Tire told me 2-3 days! Joe called me the second they arrived and told me he could fit me in to get the new one's on. He really made me feel like he was going above and beyond to make sure I could get back on the road. Joe had informed me about how much tread I had left on the front tires and the safety information. I love how he never tried to push me to buy new tires for the front, he only warned me when I'm in the safety zone. Joe is the best, hard worker I've ever met and he does an excellent job.

This has never happened to me before.  When asking for something,she rudely asked what? But to the biracial couple,she was like yes? With a pleasant smile. In the beginning,we asked to sit in their nice unreserved private area. SHE IGNORED OUR QUESTION AND TOLD US TO SIT IN THE NORMAL TABLES.

The congee was alright. Not the best which is ironic considering the restaurant's name. The vermicelli was pretty good. Overall the food was decent, but the service is pretty bad. They have enough waiters but they seem to actively avoid eye contact. I don't even care if they're polite or smile but at least try to help out customers instead of standing around. 2016-07-31 22:30:26 2.5470486\n",

      " 1igFiGJwwv05-Y_yTayZcw Unfortunately you can't give a company or business zero stars, so I will be forced to leave the review with one star. My mother and her fiancee purchased a very expensive $11K SubZero refrigerator only one week ago. This particular refrigerator was not available to see in the store, so it was purchased without being seen in person. Given that their website states they have \"top notch customer service,\" little was thought about if there would be a potential problem with the unseen refrigerator. The first delivery team to come to the house could not install the refrigerator, as they were unprepared. They did not bring the right tools to install the refrigerator, and the installation had to be rescheduled. The next team installed the refrigerator and after using the refrigerator my mother and her fiancee quickly realized this was not a good fit for them. This was for a variety of reasons, the most important being that my mom suffers from RA and back problems and the refrigerator is too heavy and bulky to open and close. My mother and her fiancee spoke with salesman, Brian, who was incredibly rude to both of them on the phone. They also spoke with the manager, Larry Flake, and finally the owner, Rick, who were both very unprofessional, rude, and offered terrible customer service. My mother and her fiancee explained their concerns and wanted to exchange the refrigerator for a different model of the same price. They had only had the refrigerator for 8 days and were willing to pay the extra delivery and setup fee, but Spencer's insisted that they would also have to pay a 25% restocking fee. To pay $11,000 for a refrigerator that does not work for an individual due to medical reasons and be forced to pay almost $3,000 for a restocking fee is disgusting. This is far, far from \"top notch customer service.\" Spencer's also said it didn't matter if the refrigerator was only one day old, they would not take it back or exchange it. This business has been \"family owned and operated for over 40 years\" and all the employees are masters at ripping people off and treating them with disrespect. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!

Five minutes after being seated waitress came by and informed us that they cannot serve pancakes since the cabinet they keep pancake mix is locked by manager who is not on shift. We started looking at other options and asked her about few other items and answer was no to french toast and few other items. So it turns out 90% of things we wanted to order were locked by manager. As we decided to leave another waiter (who was saw standing outside texting) came by and told us not to go to ihop since they have long wait times. We called ihop and they did not have any wait time. At IHOP we were treated nicely and fresh pancakes, crepes, hash browns and eggs were served without much wait. I do not think I be coming back to Denny's since we had called ahead the night before informing we would be coming early morning. But instead of quality service we got \"things are locked by manager\" and do not go to IHOP as sales pitch. They need to work on customer service and be more professional. Terrible service. I did call next day to whisper complain but the manager was not interested in reaching out after bad experience. I guess they really don't care about customers.

This afternoon, my car was hand washed and then wss pulled out in the hot sun, before anyone went to dry it.  I asked the manager of that department, JACKIE, to pull my car under the shaded area in order to finish it off.  My car is a dark blue sedan, which will spot quickly if it isn't dried quickly.  At that time, there was only one other car to by dried.  The wash line was empty also.  JACKIE refused to do so and said my car would be dried immediately.  A person started to dry my car, then JACKIE called him over to chat, and my car sat there unattended for at least 10 more minutes. At that point I went inside and was met by ROBERT.  He took over and pulled my car around to the washing area, sprayed my car with water, then returned it to the drying area (under the shaded covering).  He and ENRIQUE dried the car properly and applied a spray wax on the painted surfaces.  In my humble opinion, JACKIE needs to be trained in customer relations, before she is placed in contact with any customers.   Also, ROBERT and ENRIQUE should be commended for a job well done!\n",

I absolutely love the other locations so I was excited to check out the DT location after the game. The reason I am giving this review is due to the service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was just leaning over the edge of the bar not even paying attention to us. After awhile, I had to flag him down to get his attention. He did let us sample a few beers after I asked, but he didn't seem to like his job as he wasn't very engaging. We ordered our drinks and didn't hear from him after that. We were trying to close our tab and asked the female bartender if we could get our bill. She said you'll have to get it from him, as she was doing nothing herself.  I asked her if she could help us get his attention and she did at that point. Let me just add that the place was not packed and the staff looked bored. I mean they had time to drink beer so I would expect they have time to give to their customers. The other locations are known for the fun ambiance and excellent customer service.

You can ask me we are closing, you can wait clearly just WAIT as I was done.. but no your staff kicked me out. I was actually havING a good time with my family and left with a bad taste in my mouth. Not from your food but from your service. I know for a fact I WOULD NEVER ever refer you to anyone not bcus your food was great but your service was so bad it pissed me off.  i am so upset. I was watching the tv and laughing with my frends and family while walking out.  Your staff come in my face takes the remote and SHUTS THE TV DOWN.. SERIOUSLY? This is what you do when the customer is looking at the tv and talking about it. you should train  your employees. i don't give a shit if its 9:59 or 9:58 if a customer is sitting there.. just wait until they are gone.. bcus you gotta clean up anyway. thats the problem with HALAL places. either their service is bad, food or they are high priced for no reason. i thought you were worth it but i guess everyone falls in one category..

About a year ago my fiancé and I moved to lake las Vegas and had to drop our cox service since they are unable to provide service in the lake Las Vegas community. When we first signed up we were told we could have the highest speed of Internet available but when the technician showed up to set up our internet he let us know we would not be able to get their highest internet speed. We accepted this. A few months later... Aka December 2015, we had an unexplained late charge added to our account. We attempted to contact customer service via online chat 3 times. During each chat session we were explaining that we had a history and proof of our payments being withdrawn we were hung up on. I decided after failed online chat attempts to give them a call. I was then hung up on 2 more times. So we ended up paying the late charge since everyone refused to help us... And kept hanging up on us. Recently our bill was increased (which I understand happens sometimes) but I was met with an idiotic customer service rep who told me how much my bill had increased... Which is information I provided him with at the beginning of the chat. He then told me after me asking multiple times if he could explain why my bill had increased, that I would have to call billing who then was unable to locate my account and told me I didn't actually have an account with them. After having a late fee added and our bill increasing an being met with incompetent customer service reps that are unable to transfer calls and look up your account info... I would never recommend this company to anyone. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO WITH COX, please save yourself the trouble and go with them...

      " h5zB3ocvKdJ5nmIkoR5EaQ This place is abhorrent in almost every way.  I had previously been twice with friends and I wasn't too impressed with the food and thought the service was a bit slow.  Also the location is a bit skeezy.  Recently I've been twice and now this place is one of few restaurants anywhere that I will never ever go back to.\n",

      "I bought a couple of Groupons a while back and they were about to expire so I wanted to use them.  I went on Monday in the afternoon and had to wait about 5 minutes for the cashier to get off the phone to take my order.  I presented my Groupon and then he informed me that if I bought certain items while using the Groupon, the price would go up.  For example one of their meals that was $12.99 without the Groupon would be $16.99 with the Groupon.  I guess partnering with Groupon and then overcharging is one way to increase business without losing money in the short term, but you do it at the expense of pissing off new customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway I ordered a two kabob plates without salads (just meat, bread, and rice) and some dolmeh to go.  The place was entirely empty when I came in but a couple of others came in after me.  After about 10 minutes the dolmeh was brought out to me on a plate and I had to remind them that it was an order to go, so they took it back.  After over 20 minutes my order was ready to go.  However both plates contained salads so I had to spend another 5 minutes dumping the salad out.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the food goes, the BBQ chicken kabob was repulsive -- the chicken itself was OK but the sauce on it and the rice was disgusting.  The beef kabob was really fatty/gristly and I had to spit half of it out.  My girlfriend, who I gave the dolmeh to, said that there was a weird red sauce in the dolmeh she hadn't seen before and she thought maybe the tomatoes were bad quality and dyed red.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still had one more Groupon to go, so I went on Wednesday.  This time the cashier from Monday was there, but the main cashier was an older man (the owner perhaps?).  I got my Groupon out and he said that I could not use it for take out, it was dine-in only.  I showed him the details of it and that it was valid for take-out and he said \"OK well then if you use it we have to charge you 15% gratuity.\"  At that point I just left.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, long story short, the people who are here are trying to drum up business by partnering with Groupon, Yelp, Restaurant.com and then when the customers arrive they are being charged more up front for many menu items, possibly being restricted to dining-in only when that's not stated ahead of time, and then being charged gratuity on top of everything, possibly even for take-out (if they allow it!).  \n",

Approx 10 sets of tires over 15 years.  Today, their demeanor and professionalism sucked.  I was informed the exact same tires that I previously had on my car that lasted 49K miles, are currently at their last possible rotation after less than 25K miles. I got no explanation, other than, \"yea, you'll need to replace them soon.\"  Next, as I hand the guy my keys, he says it will be two hours to rotate my tires.  If you told me this up front, you could have saved us both some time.  Don't assume your customers have 2 hours to spare for tire rotation, it isn't logical.  If it will take more than an hour, just tell us up front and we'll stop by when you aren't so busy.  At the end, I'm waiting for my car to be pulled out of the garage.  While I'm sure the loud Rap music is fun for guys working on cars it just annoys me.  Next, the guy pulling out my car drives right past me standing 5 feet from him, and parks at the far end of the lot.  So, I wait for him to get back inside the building, where it's just me and two employees.  One guy is bitching about how an employee failed to get the make and model of a car on his paperwork, and what an idiot he is.  Guess what?   I don't give a sh*t about your internal dirty laundry!

      "Cons: High turn over, poor customer service on the phone or in person - example: said the tech was at our house on Friday at 237pm, as u can see in our picture taken at 4pm, no baskets were cleaned. And on a Seperate occassion, i mentioned to the tech that our system was showing \"low salt\". He said he would take care of it, i watched him put chemicals into the pool and within 24 hours our pool was dark swampy green. Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until Monday AFTERNOON to take a look at our pool that their person turned green. They did clean our salt cell and we had to run our pump for 72 hours straight to rectify the green pool. Aka: high electricity bill that month. \n",

      "Overall, if you actually see a tech show up they are here for less than 5 minutes, never the same one, dont complete the tasks they advertise for $80/month and you will be disappointed by the customer service you recieve when you call the office. We gave them a valiant effort & thousands of dollars but HIGHLY HIGHLY do NOT recommend & its time to move on. 2017-02-06 17:34:58 2.3903537\n",

To start EVERYTHING off when they came to my house to install the internet and wifi, the guy literally did nothing but hook up the box.  He left the box it came in on the desk circling the WRONG password for the box.  I should have run at this point.  Complained... Silence..  I really tried to fix things with their tech support (or shall we say NO tech support). They offer services such as selective call block and then when you really need to use it you can't because.......you cant block long distance numbers.  Are you kidding me!!! Their wifi worked in my house, however it would constantly stop working off on off on off off off.  Their solution.... go to Amazon and buy a booster for your house!  Are you freaking serious!! I filed complaints and never was any follow up contact made.  THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! And I thought Direct TV was contracted with them for some areas. So why was it that even after telling them that Direct TV was my carrier, they still tried to poach their customer.  Wow.  Steer clear unless you like doing all the tech stuff yourself but still paying as much as if they were doing the tech work for you. And if you don't need wifi then this is definately the company for you.  Good riddance CenturyLink!  If I could I would give them 0 stars! 2015-05-07 21:01:21 2.3903537\n",

I purchased a mini detail which is interior and exterior cleaning, and something else that was listed was \"upholstery/leather treatment\". I would have thought this meant the seats, but apparently it didn't, it meant the dashboard and the display console area (steering wheel also) pretty much the dashboard the of car. My feedback to the owner is this can be a little deceptive because upholstery and leather treatment sounds like the seats. So none of my seats were clean and the door also had some oily fingerprints on it, they didn't clean the door. This was ok because I told them and they did an awesome job of cleaning. A couple other things is nobody seemed like they were on the same page, I asked the lady in side what the leather treatment meant and she said \"I don't know, ask the guy out there\" then I asked if there was a menu for a description and she said no. I really feel like some description for the services would be helpful to customers. Again to the owner - bump up your review status! If your customers aren't happy, make up for it!

This was my FIRST experience getting my hair blown out.  I am a teacher with HARDLY ANY MONEY, but wanted to spend a little extra on myself for my husband's Christmas party.  I wanted to NOT worry about doing it on my own.   I had booked the appointment for a blow out and hot tools (I wanted curls).  The arrival was fine and seemed normal.  When I went to get my hair blown out I described to the girl that I was going to a fancy Christmas party and wanted my hair to look elegant.  She spun the chair away from the mirror for the entire appointment, so I never got to see what she was doing (issue #1).  She was curling my hair during the blow dry part, which was fine, if she knew what she was doing.  Then she spun back around, and said \"okay, you're all finished.\"  My hair did NOT look finished.  It looked ratty and NOT elegant for a nice Christmas party.  I said, it didn't look finished and that many parts looked like they needed to be combed.  I kept pointing out areas & also reminded her I had scheduled the appointment for hot tools as well and maybe she should finish the curls with the hot tool.  She did not even know I had booked the appointment with hot tools (bad communication with front desk and hair person- issue #2).  She kept asking how the curls looked (issues #3).... well, they looked fine, but the part & rattiness of my hair looked like I had already been out partying on scottsdale rd., possible WALK OF SHAME, hairstyle.  I question this stylists taste level & hated that I had to pick apart the hair-do, so I didn't leave in tears.  I waited until the car to cry about my hair because now I had wasted two hours of my life, was going to be running late for the Christmas party, & spent $$$ on my hair that I WENT HOME AND WASHED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Also, at home was the only place I was able to actually see my hair, because she never even gave me a mirror to check out the back of my hair (issue #4).  She was hiding the job she did and made me feel awkward, sitting in a chair, pointing out places to fix.  She wanted to get the job done and did not care AT ALL about the actual hairstyle.  \n",

After checking out yelp, it seems as though no one from this company even looks at what customers are saying because there are A LOT of unhappy people out there & obviously the problems have no been fixed.

      " PBY37mMi2frly0tWnLd8dA I purchased the Groupon for a full synthetic oil change and went to Classic Car Spa last week (the Warner location). First issue with the place- there is no clear signage on where to pull your car up for an oil change but what makes me give them a horrible review is their customer service and their hidden charges. Here is the story: I pulled my car up, the attendant asked if I wanted a car wash, I informed him that I had the groupon for an oil change and just wanted the oil change. He then stated, \"the classic car wash is free with an oil change,\" I said \"even with the groupon?\" he said, \"yes\". So of course, I agreed, I mean why would I pass up a free car wash? Another gentleman then tried to sell me on additional services like a $5 wax, etc., I declined as oil changes are expensive enough, hence the purchase of a groupon. Here is where they fail greatly in customer service and communication: I received my invoice and took it to the cashier along with my groupon, there was a problem with the invoice and after about 15 min of me standing and waiting, they were finally able to ring me up. I wasn't expecting to pay anything as I already paid $45.00 for the oil change via groupon, well, to my shock the cashier informs me my total is $17.73! I asked why, they said I have to pay for the car wash as it is not free when using the groupon because, and I quote, \"the groupon is already such a good deal.\" I then informed her that the attendant told me that the car wash was free even with the groupon, had I known there would be an additional charge, I would NOT have agreed to the car wash. She then proceeded to tell me that it states it on the groupon, she looked over my groupon voucher (where there is nothing said regarding the car wash) and said, \"well.... its here on the groupon somewhere... I know its not free when using the groupon because my Manager said it's not free when using the groupon...\" Well... okay..at this point, I reiterated to her that I was told by the attendant outside that it was free even with the groupon.  She refused to do anything about it and honestly, after standing there watching all of the incompetence happening, I just needed to get out of there. Terrible customer service. She should have apologized for the miscommunication with the employee and not charged me for something I did NOT agree to (or) at the very least, offer a discount for another service in the future. On another note, full synthetic oil changes are typically $65.00; I paid a total of $62.73, that is NOT a deal as I never agreed to the car wash! I could have used my $10.00 off coupon at one of the other places in the area. To top it off, once your car is finished, they come in the waiting room and  yell out the make and model of your car, you then go outside to complete disorganization and chaos; I had to maneuver my car out between the other cars, then was directed to out the side of the building (very narrow) in order to get out of there.   My advice, don't go here unless you want horrible customer service and want to be charged for add on's that you don't agree to. 2015-08-13 00:03:38 2.3439953\n",

As we got out of the car a windshield guy approached me to fix a crack I said no (you can clearly see him pointing and looking at the windshield) he still proceeded to try and sell me the service through my insurance. We then went inside to pay... I paid for the wash with my card and asked the cashier to break a  $20... I asked for one $10 and two $5's... She gave me one $10 one $5 and five $1's was not what I asked for and she didn't bother explaining or counting my money back to me. The best part of this experience was sitting in the lobby. After 15 min I got up to see what was taking so long. I notice my car sitting in the middle of the road baking in the sun with the door wide open. It was a good 20ft away from any employee with the keys still in it. I started to get in and a lady (same lady who told me a couple weeks ago the avgerage tip was $20 when I called her out she then said it was $5) came over asking for my receipt. I gave it to her plus $7 in $1's. My wife and I got in and the inside was not even remotely close to being wiped down. In your video you will see me get out go to an employee ask for a rag and go back to wipe down my own car.

Trying to close out my tab took another half hour. I asked for the check and a box twice. Another bartender came in around 7 but he was of very little assistance.

I only went here because I had an hour to kill in the area and was beyond needing a pedicure.  I walked in the door and there were 3 ladies sitting able to work, but had NOT ONE customer inside the place. I should have left then.  I picked a color and on my way to the chair I dropped the polish.  I immediately said how sorry I was and asked if they would give me something to clean it up with.  Not one lady got up and offered to clean it up or even help, they were busy yelling at each other about me dropping the polish.  One finally threw a dry towel to me.  I asked if I could please have polish remover and started wiping up the tile.  She came over and poured polish remover so I cleaned up all of the mess.  I asked for one more towel to finish it, so you would never have been able to tell it was dropped but she wouldn't give me one more.  NOW, I am certainly NOT the first person to ever drop a polish bottle like this, but it was MY first time ever.  They had no plans of trying to make me feel like it was okay or that this could ever happen in their shop.  All of them were RUDE and spoke Vietnamese the entire time I was there.  No customer service skills whatsoever from any employee/owner in the place.  I paid $32 for the Deluxe pedicure and was not even offered a design at the end.  I was in the chair at 11:45 and walking out the door at 12:10 - all done.  The job was terrible, she was extremely rough (maybe to show me she was really mad at the dropped polish) very rude people technicians, and the place was not clean.  Some kind of roach was on the floor by my chair which I took a picture of but don't know how to post it.....  I paid $5.00 extra for the broken bottle of polish and I still gave a $10 tip, which was very stupid of me.

He did find grids and advised us he would drop the grids off early the week of May 7th but that he would call us to advise us when he in fact had dropped the grids off.  About the only thing you did agree with our office staff is that he did not drop them off until the afternoon of May 10 and when he called us that day he expected an appointment immediately.  We advised him we could not guarantee somebody out there as our schedule was full but we would try to get somebody there that day or Friday.  He was aware that we were booking at that time for the following week.  If he had dropped the grids off earlier in the week as he had advised us he would we would have been able to get this resolved before the weekend of May 12/13, 2012.

It is understandable that home owners are trying to cut back on expenses but we cannot take the heat for that situation.  You really need to take this up with Mr. A.

Although you have an ever-so-convenient drive-thru and later hours, I've decided that Ricardo's food just tastes better!  I just wish that Ricardo's offered the same hot sauce that Federico's uses - those ever-present little plastic cups filled with red saucy goodness.  Ricardo's does have a salsa bar, but it's definitely not a highlight, IMO.  Pretty much everything I've tried here is tasty, especially their beans (I love refried beans).  Prices are decent.  The staff is always pleasant, and the place is pretty clean.  I'm sold--a happy repeat customer! 2016-05-24 05:45:45 2.2334123\n",

      " gFPp7qDc0k26LkagxO4D4g I was sold a lemon the end of November 2016.  I reported the issues before driving the CX-9 off the lot to Michael Knox and he stated the car just needed a system update.  Since then this car has been in their service department over 8 times.  I've been treated so poorly there and each person just passes the buck even though the General Manager and the Parts Manager who is no longer there stated the car was unsafe to drive.  I've had 2 rentals and the owner's dealer car.  The owner will not handle this situation.  The infotainment system continues to malfunction and turn off in the middle of driving to my destinations and 2 weeks ago in the same week the same tire went flat without any warning until the tire was burning on the metal.  The manager would not match Discount Tire's price and then refused to service me at his dealership over the phone.  He was verbally abusive, condescending, immature and unprofessional.  His name is George Salman.  He is an amateur.  I have escalated this to Mazda Customer Care and will be retaining a Lemon Law attorney.  I have been taken advantage of being a single educated mother who knows medicine and not cars.  It's outrageous the way I have been ignored and mistreated and will be escalating this guaranteed.  I even went as far and recorded all conversations with the General Manager, Parts Manager and the intake person which all agreed that the problem cannot be fixed and deemed it a Lemon but no one will do anything about it.  It's unsafe and they won't replace my car or settle with me.  George Salman did not behave as a professional that has been in the business. He treats customers like dirt. He gave me more of a difficult time due to a malfunction that they sold to me. The electronic system is flawed. Both times my tires became flat no warn ing light came on and just the other night the infotainment system went out during my drive home late at night with 2 small boys. George Salman and Matt the parts manager stated the car was unsafe and most likely could not be resolved. I have not ever been treated with such poor customer service like this man treated me with witnesses. It's all documented and I'm a highly skilled RN. I had to bring it back over 5 times and each time was a struggle. He made it so difficult when I was sold a car that shouldn't have been sold. The wait time, the abuse, the load of crap and excuses. He had no idea how to handle the situation and George Salman disparaged his own company that he works for. This truly has been a nightmare and I've only owned higher end cars. I will update the outcome. 2017-05-01 04:04:36 2.2002487\n",

      "However, very few people I know like to pay for parking while they are grocery shopping. If you park in the upstairs ramp even for ten minutes and run in to grab something quick without paying the meter, you will end up with a $25 parking ticket. SO RIDICULOUS. There is current construction within the Monroe Street area and it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack when it comes to parking. I understand that its a Trader Joes thing to not appeal to customers as some giant corporation or whatever, so they make their store parking lots micro sized, making any and all persons who try and find a spot have a panic attack all because they want to get some soy milk and bananas. There are two major issues here: The lots are WAY too small and the parking is too limited, AND they make you pay to park. I can imagine this is probably because of people parking there for extended periods of time that are not customers, but good god, people make it two hour parking so people have a chance to park freely and if they overstay their parking time, THEN ticket them. This whole situation just makes my blood boil. So, if you want great food and excellent service please support Trader Joes, but don't expect that you'll be free of paying for parking, getting a ticket, or having a small fit while trying to find a place to park. 2014-11-03 18:59:51 2.197299\n",

Once upstairs, I found my friends and sat down.  They were already halfway into dinner service and they let me know that the service was horrible and no one really understood english.  I wasn't going for the All You Can Eat so we asked the waiter for a menu so I could order an item from their dinner menu.  It took them at least ten minutes to bring the menu over and another ten minutes to get my order put through and fill up our cups with water and tea.  The dinner itself, surprisingly, was not too long of a wait and I decided on the Beef Bibimbap, which was very tasty and I demolished the whole thing myself.  While I was eating my dinner, my coworkers were on dessert.  Little did they know that ice cream was not included in AYCE and you have to pay an extra $2 something to order ice cream (which only consisted of chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, green tea and red bean).  Other korean restaurants I've been to for AYCE has always included ice cream and a wide variety of desserts in their dinner service.. None the less, I think I'll stick to my regular korean BBQ restaurants that charge more for AYCE dinner and includes dessert and sushi with better customer service.  Korean Grill House will probably be my last resort for last minute cravings for korean BBQ, the food is delicious don't get me wrong.  They just need to work on including dessert and having more staff in house to serve and cater to good paying customers that are cooking their own food in their restaurant. 2015-03-17 12:42:27 2.197299\n",

The real issue was the host named SILVER wouldnt give them a table when they were next on the waitlist. Instead she gave it to the 2 groups of 3 ppl that was on the end of the waitlist. When my sister asked why they couldn't get the table she said because the table offers 6 pots so she couldn't just leave that one pot space to waste. She was sooo rude and had such bad customer service!!! Never go to this restaurant!!!! Don't waste your time!!! AND at the end my sister left...poor sis. 2014-12-20 06:39:59 2.188498\n",

Deep-fried chicken chunks in a thin sauce with pepper flecks and plenty of sesame seeds. Better than versions with thick and sugar-sweet sauce, but needing a bigger punch of flavor to be memorable.

I loved the spacious rooms, elevators were fast and parking was plenty and free. Check out was excellent. I was able to do late check out with no hassle (ended up not needing it). The breakfast was hot and plentiful. The staff at breakfast was nice. Only minor complaint was check-in. I wasn't acknowledged as a Hilton honors member and the Latin lady doing the checking in was very dismissive, constantly checking her phone and almost rude. She didn't tell me about the happy hour, had to ask where my room and elevators were located. But overall her lack of customer service did not dampen my stay there! I will return! 2017-09-19 18:06:30 2.188498\n",

I called in for a haircut and made an appointment with Lisa, apparently a newcomer to Shine (but not, mind you, a newcomer to the business).  I've had a lot of bad experiences with salons and my thick, short hair so I tend to go to a salon once and never come back. Nonetheless, Lisa was super friendly and engaging.  I have very thick hair and she did an amazing job with thinning it out, and didn't get annoyed with the weight like many stylists have.  The haircut is easy to style when I'm in a time crunch but I can also put a little more effort into it and make it look more glam.  It's by far the best haircut I've had in years, and I will definitely be a returning customer. 2011-01-13 16:27:30 2.188498\n",

I was happy with the large portion of noodles, but the veggies and tofu was lacking, same with the sauce. It seemed there was no sauce. And it was supposedly a spicy option. :(  So over all, judging the food, I was disappointed. Also I ordered spring rolls to go with my order, and for $15 bucks, I get plain noodles and super basic spring rolls that were over priced. I'd rather just go to a real Thai/Vietnamese place. Sorry.

My issue was with the manager who worked there. She was very unprofessional and did not listen to any of my concerns. When I made my appointments I specifically told them that I am only paying for makeup and that some of my ladies with be getting their hair done on their own and that I do not want their hair to go under my contract. Well needless to say she did not care about this and I ended up paying for the hair too, when I told the manager that I was not suppose to pay for the hair she just gave me a smug smirk and said, \"What you want me to refund you the money, and have them pay for it?\" and then she laughed like it was something ridiculous to do. One of my bridesmaids actually had walk away because she could not take how the manager was talking down to and treating me. On top of that when I went for my trial I was told that eyelashes are included ($15 value, but they are ardelle brand that you can get at walgreens for $5) but I could upgrade to the Mink Winks and just pay the difference. Well when on the day of my wedding I upgraded they charged by the full amount $35 and when I asked the manager about this charge she told me that, that is not how it is done and that there is nothing that can be done about it, really? Come on I was a manger in customer service once and every manager knows that if a customer was told something by one of your employees you need to honor it, but nope obviously this manager has no clue.

I have to admit that despite their many options, I've only tried the Super Battleship, a 2 foot Italian sub.  At only $14, it's quite a deal and great for parties.  It's packed with fresh meats and cheeses, lettuce, onion, tomato and sprinkled with oil and vinegar and oregano.  Some might say it's the perfect sandwich.  It's definitely remained one of my favorites. 2013-02-20 08:10:09 2.1038795\n",

Despite most of the staff being nice to your face, at least two were quite unprofessional. I made it clear that I was flying at a busy time and would need a timely shuttle to the airport. One of the staff booked the flight in a friendly manner but did not actually write it down. By the time I was waiting downstairs there was no evidence of a shuttle having been booked. This by itself would not have merited a 2 star review but the lady working the desk on a Sunday night did not so much as apologize. She just acted like it wasn't her fault and didn't know what happened.

I really liked the creamy flavor of the black milk tea, but we were disappointed that one small cup cost approximately $4.75. On top of that, there is 75% ice in the cup and 25% liquid.

      " 6tqo8F53g3dHhPqoEi3hIQ In general,  I enjoy Great Harvest Bread Company;  I used to eat at locations before I moved here and love the location on Hualapai.  The is was my first venture to this location.  I happened to see it in route to the furniture store and decided to come back for lunch after my purchase. The first thing I noticed,  no welcome when entering..it's a small thing,  but the extra touch that I'm used to at other locations (the store did a a few people, but not by any means crowded).  There was a young lady ringing people and a couple of people in line;  another passed me to take a sandwich to someone, without so much as a peep. I paused the bread slices awaiting my turn, the young lady went back behind the counter, no comment,  no offer of bread. It was my turn so I went to order; no smiles or kindness from the young lady ringing. ..only appeared to be annoyed as I smiled and told her how much I enjoyed the other location and it was my first time there. I asked a question, and with a roll of the eye, was told they didn't have the item I requested. I ordered the sandwich, she rang order & pushed the receipt to me across the counter (not for signature,  but my copy. .is it too much to ask to hand a customer a receipt ). She did ask me if I would like bread/butter, and when giving it to me did the same,  sat it on the counter near the register and slid it across. All the while with a scowl.  The young lady who brought my sandwich, no smile,  appeared irritated as well. The sandwich was ok; great pesto, but the ends of the bread were harder than I'm used to for some reason and the shredded iceberg lettuce was wilted. Perhaps an off day, perhaps selective with niceties, I don't know,  but the staff did not make a good impression to me at this location. With a range of options for good food, I tend to choose places with good customer service. Perhaps management can work on this with staff and perhaps things may improve...I guess time will tell. 2015-06-26 22:33:31 2.0330977\n",

I took him up on the offer and came in and he redid my nails. They looked great when he finished but as he painted them, he made comments about not doing designs because his clientele is high end and high end people don't like designs (another reviewer posted that he made similar comments to her, as well).

We ordered a lobster roll and poke bowl and were given a playing card as a number (which seemed to be very confusing for the food runners - they had to come close to every table just to see the specific card). We waited...we waited some more...people came, ate, and left and we still were not fed. After 45 minutes of becoming increasingly hungry and impatient I asked the female food-runner to confirm that our food was coming. She looked very flustered and said \"I'll check hold on...I don't get paid enough for this\". She checked and let us know she told the manager as she continued to bustle around complaining to different diners about how little she was being paid which was odd. After another 10-15 minutes the manager came over and let us know that the ticket didn't make it to the kitchen for whatever reason and kept saying he had no idea what happened (assuring...a manager who has no idea what happened or how to handle it). After another few minutes he put the food in front of us and instead of offering a concession or making any real effort to mitigate our inconvenience he said \"here's a cookie to smooth you over\" and walked away. \"To smooth you over\"...really? Maybe I am a little more conscious of customer service and hospitality having worked in hospitality and property management, but I was pretty shocked. \n",

My tire needed to be changed because of a nail so he couldn't do my requested car diagnostics. Ok well I understand the policy of Mazda however I'm having a hard time financially and I bought a used tire and brought it with me and because of policy again he said his manager didn't. Allow a perfectly good tire to be replaced. I explained to him I'll go get it fix. He then ignored the go way and beyond policy you have and didn't even bother to try to make a new appointment . Actually he seemed aloof and disconnected that I only had the loaner washed and gassed up due to having it fmduring the weekend when your service department is closed on sundays. I did call and convey a message to the answering service the day he called and said that my car was done. Which is wasn't. I have the message voicemail. I left upset and unhappy! I not only didn't get my oil changed or the requested diagnostics handled in my vehicle . I completely felt obsolete and unimportant to not only the second car I purchased with Mazda but he didn't understand why I was upset. I went up and down trying to afford a tire and then the price of oil etc etc. I left to get the tire hanged but didn't return because I've been completely discouraged with this company not only with the service department but your core values! I'm so upset even writing this thing that when I purchased both cars I was given and told the impression that you. Your core values would be that of a satisfied customer. I'm UNHAPPY WITH CHASE IM UNHAPPY WITH MAZDA. Be ware people . I don't understand car functions but. Customer service I'm a pro at . With frustrated regards \n",

      " UIyz_DrmP2MumG2ZpdA3Lg I have never had such a bad experience dining in a restaurant as I have with this steakhouse. We came with a party of 15 people which, originally, was supposed to be 20 people. At the end of the meal they put the cheque as a single one, which wasn't really an issue since we expected that, but we also noticed a $300 surcharge on top of an already $1000 bill!! We asked why they put that there and they said that because some of the party members didn't show up they had to \"make up for the lost profit for the scheduled staff and the room we put aside for the party. There is also an average of each person spending $100 and we were expecting your table to average $2000. Sorry but this is business.\" I'm sorry but what sort of restaurant does this without first telling their customers? Their reasoning is also a load of BS because they put their business expectations on the customer rather than anticipating that maybe some people don't show up when there is a party like other normal and decent restaurants do. \n",

      "Now, they put this on the bill and did not mention this the first time when we called them to reserve for the party, nor the second time we called to tell them that there would be less people coming.

      "Had this not happened I would have rated the restaurant much higher because the food was actually decent (though really not worth the price in my opinion). However, the trick with the $300 was such an underhanded and disgusting practice that I don't recommend this place to anyone, nor will I ever, and will find a way to let the business bureau know so that they cannot do this to other people. Our party was fortunate because we had someone contest the bill on our behalf but I am so sure that they have gotten away with this in the past with other poor victims. \n",

I was hoping to find the same bread that I got in Virginia--one that had all seeds, but they told me they all do their own thing. That bread was the best bread I ever had. I still get their white bread and honey bread. The bread is pricey, but I do love them. I love how they give free, huge slices of bread with butter on them to try. I've taken advantage of this to try some of their desserts. Sometimes I'll like them enough to buy them. Although I love their bread, this store only deserves three stars (possibly less) because they are seriously lacking in customer service.
