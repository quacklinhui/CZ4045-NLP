      "pack a lunch! it took 35 minutes to get my car into the tunnel with only 4 cars ahead of me. it was well over an hour for a basic wash. i could see dirt left on my car when it came out of the tunnel. they let the car dry and then wiped it down with a damp rag. i assume that is not good for the paint.the wash was terrible. i recommend going to clean freak carwash if you expect to get what you pay for.\n",
      "don't go here! the sales guys are complete slime balls! the service sucks and the wash is even worse. i watched the girl wax my car, then clean my wheels, then clean my interior windows and leather seats all with the same rag. i now have a waxy residue all over the inside of my windshield. \n",
      "\n",
      "not to mention that they slopped armorall all over my car, so now there is greasy patches all over my seats. \n",
      "\n",
      "to add insult to injury the sales guy sold me on the $50 ultimate package. i know it is normal and customary to haggle so i did and the lowest he said he could do is take $5 off... i tried to do better and he swore up and down that, this was the best he could do. he then walked over to the machine and printed out a ticket for my was + $5 for \"washing my floormats\" which is included- then handed me a $10 off ultimate car wash coupon. the slime ball could have given me the $10 off coupon but instead tried to milk me for an additional $5. i asked the cashier if that was normal and she just rolled her eyes and agreed with me that it was shady. \n",

      "they do a very poor  job for what you pay. if you have a higher end car, they will ruin the paint.  they are declining over the years. i used to be able to get reasonable wash here. now the jets that spray the pink and blue foam are clogged and only drop globs of foam instead of an even layer of spray. the pre rinse/wash is non existent on my last 2 visits. i paid for a spray wax. 5 out 6 times they tried to say they were done without ever touching the roof. there are several people walking around with manger printed on their shirts that don't seem to give a darn about the type of work being done. the other huge turn off is the high pressure sales tactics to upgrade whatever service you are requesting. \n",

      "other than the fact that they sell sinclair gas i can't think of a reason to go back. i just had the truck washed, and i'm not expecting a detail, but for the super, i expect my truck to actually be clean i shouldn't have to hunt on the floor for my things that were in the cup holders! i will not return!\n",

      "on inspection of the car wash after i left the property i noticed some residue on the top, hood and trunk. i returned to the location and asked the check in attendant if he thought the car wash result were up to their standards. his response was to get a bottle of something and a rag and try to improve the results. it was obvious that the residue was soap that had dried because the entry from the first soap application and the entry to the tunnel was for some reason delayed. i asked if it was possible to re-wash the car and he went on a long spiel on how the car needed clay and detailing.\n",
      "i left, went to a spray wand wash down the street and it was like a miracle...no clay, no detailing just washed the soap dried residue off and the car looked like it should after drying.\n",

      "i was also in need of an oil change.  this location is right around the corner from my house, and they did a fantastic job.  i pulled in and right away was assisted.  i got the oil change and a full service car wash.   i love that they didn't try to up-sell me on all kinds of additional services, like air filters.  i did decline a decent deal on steam cleaning the interior, but i know they will probably offer me that same deal anytime i go, so i wasn't that worried about passing up the deal of a lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "they changed the oil in about 15 minutes, and then washed the car.  they spend a long time going over all the cracks and seams with compressed air to blow all the water out, and then hand wipe the car down.  when they were done, i didn't even recognize my car - i had forgotten what color it was under all the arizona dust.   (fyi - it's red).\n",

      "great place to get your car washed . they took great care of my new silverado . this will be the only place i come from now on.\n",
      "i haven't seen the work done yet so i'll update this review.  however, i specifically asked about purchasing the basic wash and what the charge would be to add shampooing the floor mats.  the gentleman said i could purchase the deluxe wash $49.99 which included the floor mats or a full floor mat/interior shampoo for $59.99 and he'd comp the wash.  sitting in the lobby right now and there is a sign that says additional services offered shampoo carpeted mats $2.50 each.  i appreciate this person trying to help me but spending the extra money for services i didn't desire when they do offer the very thing i inquired about is frustrating.\n",
      "i've gone to so many other car wash places but i always come back here. the wash it's self is pretty good. they go over it was hand mitts and then through the wash. the guys at the end though who do the drying/detailing really make the difference. i always tip the detail guy since they make the cars shine. i'm a big fan since they vacuum, spray the windows/mirrors/glass and detail the wheels nicely. they have coupons on their website and are in mailings as well as those coupon big books some schools/stores sell. also they have a punch card type system where after i believe 10 washes you get one free.  \n",
      "\n",
      "it is not quick so don't come in thinking you will get your car back in 5 minutes, all sparkly clean. it takes time for them to do it right. i've seen them work almost 25 minutes on the detailing part before so depending on how dirty your car is how long it might take. if you want a quick wash n' go you might want to take your car somewhere else.\n",
      "great carwash/detail!!! conveniently located and great prices. especially the groupon, attentive to detail. love this car wash and all of the other locations here in the valley the only place i would go.\n",
      "they are only good for washing you car and thats it! just paid $40 to have my headlights restored but now it has more scratches on it than before.  i asked the guy over to redo it 4 times and he finally said thats the best he can do.  they only use one rough sand paper and no fine sanding to sand out the fine scratches.  sh*tty-est piece of so called \"professional\" work i've seen.  never again!\n",

      "there was nothing \"ultimate\" about the car wash i just received for $45 at this facility.  i found trash left under the back seat & driver's seat, crumbs in the crevices of the front passenger seat, hand prints on the back window, and bugs on my headlights.  i could've given my 4 year old a dish towel, a bucket, and some palmolive and gotten a cleaner car.  just terrible...\n",
      "i wanted to like this place; especially since it's down the street from my house- but i can't. as soon as a pulled-in i knew i wanted a mid-level wash but no sooner than i put in my request the attendant tried to upsell me like crazy. i went inside to pay for and wait for my car to be finished; little did i know that it would be nearly 40 minutes before i got my car back! ugh!!! once my car was finally ready, as soon as i jumped in i noticed they did a half butt job on the vacuuming (for pete sakes i could still easily see a french fry stuck between the seats-smh!). i'm willing to give this place another try only because i just got a coupon in a money mailer  but they better be faster or at least thoroughly clean my car if it is going to take that long.\n",
      "double check and do your research before taking your vehicle here for an oil change. i find them a bit dishonest. i was charged 90.00 for a synthetic oil change for a 4cyl sedan under 50k. i was first quoted 75. at any rate, that's what i paid for my lincoln navigator when i had it. instead of arguing, i decided to post my experience here where i feel will have greater impact than dealing with a manager on duty. \n",
      "\n",
      "combined, i give it 2 stars for the cleanliness of the facility and the decent job they did on my car. i just returned from a road trip and had bug and road grime all over the front. may get the groupon for car washes only. but we will see. not looking good to see more cars waiting to be dried than workers doing the drying\n",

      "\n",
      "one star...\n",
      "love the detail that the staff includes , even on a basic wash and always offer a great deal for other services as well. they do take time to get in the cracks and crevices and do a fabulous job, so plan on being patient as its well worth it!!\n",

      "better than expected.   less wait time than the val vista/ williams field location.  thorough cleaning for the basic\n",
      "overall i'm going with just ok. had high expectations due to constantly seeing many luxury cars come here. i took mine, they were very careful with the black paint and did an exterior wax. they left spots of wax on the car still but overall exterior was really nice. interior, i don't like being able to see spots that were treated and spots they completely missed. id be happy with a wipedown and no treatment than a half ass one. otherwise really liked the waiting area, car is clean and the 72 hour rain guarantee is awesome, especially during monsoon season. i have a groupon so i have a couple more washes, will update if next round is better!\n",
      "4-star work, but a star knocked off for glacially slow service. all the local car washes seem to move at a snail's pace, which i don't understand - part of the reason i'm willing to pay somebody else to do it is for the speed & convenience. if you take 30 minutes (when not even busy) to get me out of there, you've defeated a lot of the purpose. but at least i've always been satisfied with the end result here. shake a leg and i'll update my review accordingly.\n",
      "my truck needed to be washed inside and out in a bad way.  i have a yellow lab that rides in my truck every day and sheds his hair horribly.  i dropped my truck off at 7:30 am to do inside detail with a wash and wax.  i was so happy with the results.  for the money i paid, i couldn't have asked for much more.  they shampooed the floors and seats and got 98% of the dog hair out.   it was a little pricey, but they were able to do the detail, an oil change and a radiator flush for $170 out the door.\n",

      "terrible service, over priced, and they don't do that good of a job.\n",

      "\n",
      "on top of all this, for several weeks after when i turned on my a/c, the most horrible smell you can imagine came through the vents. it wasn't there before i had the detail job done, but it was there immediately after. logic dictates it was something they did. \n",
      "\n",
      "they also put some sort of washer fluid in my reservoir that does nothing but streak up my windshield. i think it's supposed to be some sort of rain-x stuff, but (a) i live in arizona, where the cumulative rainfall for a year is negligible and (b) this negates the need for rain-x. \n",
      "\n",
      "seriously, this place is overpriced, the customer service sucked, and i regret having gone there in the first place.\n",

      "i really liked the job they did when i first came here about a year ago... they have gone down hill since then.  i did speak to the manager because the inside of my car hadn't even looked like it was touched. he did take it back and vacuum it.  not sure i will come back at $25 a visit.\n",
      "i actually had a really pleasant experience here! i purchased a groupon for an oil change and a car wash, so i called to ask if i could get an appointment. upon being told that they worked on a first come, first serve basis, i got nervous but when i arrived at this location, i didn't have to wait at all! i pulled right up into the bay and they got started on my car right away. the cashier, brittany, knew exactly what to do with my groupon and rang me out no problem. i sat for about forty minutes before my car was finished and personally, i think that's great! i'm so used to spending an hour and a half to two hours for my oil changes, but i was in and out with no problem. my only gripe is that my car had water spots on it so they didn't thoroughly dry my car after the wash, but otherwise i'm a happy camper!\n",
      "i got the basic car wash for $14.99, which included washing the exterior, vacuuming the interior, wiping down the dash, and doing the windows. this was my first time going there and and at first i thought the price was high. \n",

      "two people do a hand wash of the car. once it comes out one person vacuums the interior, wipes down the dash, cleans the interior and exterior windows, and dries off the car. the guy who did the vacuuming, wiping down the dash, etc. was very thorough and was knocking himself out to clean my car.\n",

      "junior did a great job and actually cared about making sure my car was meticulously clean inside and out..will definitely go back !!\n",
      "this is the only car wash that has never annoyed me with some little problem.  seems like every other place regularly misses something, even in a high-end wash, but these guys always do a great job.  prices are not cheap--but match the level of service given.  i've also never run into one of those glass salespeople there, which really annoy me.  overall this is my preferred wash/detail company in the phoenix area.\n",

      "i got my car washed here about 3 months ago and for being about twice the price of most of the car washes in the area they did a  pretty sloppy job. thought maybe they had a bad day so i decided to give them a second chance today (9/21/13). today was even worse than the last time. my car was already pretty clean just dusty from not being washed for a couple of weeks. when they said it was ready i looked inside and they had forgot to wipe down the inside of the car. dash still had dust, interior door panels not wiped down and the cup holders hadn't been touched. i had already tipped the employee who had cleaned and he went on to another car. i asked another employee if they had a clean rag so i could wipe down the interior. as i'm doing this the manager, a younger white guy with a buzz cut comes to me and says i have to: \"get my car out of there\". i told him they didn't wipe down the inside of the car and he gives me this dirty pissed off look, closes my door and just walks off.  won't be back a third time, too many other choices out there. don't know if the owner or upper management reads these reviews but you might want to pass on to your management on the line to check the employees work and not be rude to customers who pay $22.00 dollars to get a pretty substandard car wash.\n",
      "i purchased the groupon for a full synthetic oil change and went to classic car spa last week (the warner location). first issue with the place- there is no clear signage on where to pull your car up for an oil change but what makes me give them a horrible review is their customer service and their hidden charges. here is the story: i pulled my car up, the attendant asked if i wanted a car wash, i informed him that i had the groupon for an oil change and just wanted the oil change. he then stated, \"the classic car wash is free with an oil change,\" i said \"even with the groupon?\" he said, \"yes\". so of course, i agreed, i mean why would i pass up a free car wash? another gentleman then tried to sell me on additional services like a $5 wax, etc., i declined as oil changes are expensive enough, hence the purchase of a groupon. here is where they fail greatly in customer service and communication: i received my invoice and took it to the cashier along with my groupon, there was a problem with the invoice and after about 15 min of me standing and waiting, they were finally able to ring me up. i wasn't expecting to pay anything as i already paid $45.00 for the oil change via groupon, well, to my shock the cashier informs me my total is $17.73! i asked why, they said i have to pay for the car wash as it is not free when using the groupon because, and i quote, \"the groupon is already such a good deal.\" i then informed her that the attendant told me that the car wash was free even with the groupon, had i known there would be an additional charge, i would not have agreed to the car wash. she then proceeded to tell me that it states it on the groupon, she looked over my groupon voucher (where there is nothing said regarding the car wash) and said, \"well.... its here on the groupon somewhere... i know its not free when using the groupon because my manager said it's not free when using the groupon...\" well... okay..at this point, i reiterated to her that i was told by the attendant outside that it was free even with the groupon.  she refused to do anything about it and honestly, after standing there watching all of the incompetence happening, i just needed to get out of there. terrible customer service. she should have apologized for the miscommunication with the employee and not charged me for something i did not agree to (or) at the very least, offer a discount for another service in the future. on another note, full synthetic oil changes are typically $65.00; i paid a total of $62.73, that is not a deal as i never agreed to the car wash! i could have used my $10.00 off coupon at one of the other places in the area. to top it off, once your car is finished, they come in the waiting room and  yell out the make and model of your car, you then go outside to complete disorganization and chaos; i had to maneuver my car out between the other cars, then was directed to out the side of the building (very narrow) in order to get out of there.   my advice, don't go here unless you want horrible customer service and want to be charged for add on's that you don't agree to.\n",

      "i went to this car wash many times since it was opened.  usually, i receive a quality hand wash and drying.  this afternoon, my car was hand washed and then wss pulled out in the hot sun, before anyone went to dry it.  i asked the manager of that department, jackie, to pull my car under the shaded area in order to finish it off.  my car is a dark blue sedan, which will spot quickly if it isn't dried quickly.  at that time, there was only one other car to by dried.  the wash line was empty also.  jackie refused to do so and said my car would be dried immediately.  a person started to dry my car, then jackie called him over to chat, and my car sat there unattended for at least 10 more minutes. at that point i went inside and was met by robert.  he took over and pulled my car around to the washing area, sprayed my car with water, then returned it to the drying area (under the shaded covering).  he and enrique dried the car properly and applied a spray wax on the painted surfaces.  in my humble opinion, jackie needs to be trained in customer relations, before she is placed in contact with any customers.   also, robert and enrique should be commended for a job well done!\n",

      "this letter is to complain about the poor level of service i recently received from a classic car spa wash.   i live in the islands right across the street from classic car spa on mcqueen and elliot and have driven by many times. just so happened this particular day i needed a wash in a hurry and thought i would give them a try. as i pulled in the salesman greeted me and went over the menu. he told me their top wash was the #5...the ultimate wash. it was supposed to consist of the supreme package plus carnuba express wax, leather lotion on dash, door and middle console, and conditioning the floor mats. so i went with it. make note this was at 1:45pm. well at 2:30 they said my vehicle was ready. to my surprise not so much. as soon as i opened up the car it was apparent it had not been vacuumed yet, the glass has not been cleaned along with everything else. i asked the gentleman who was presenting the vehicle if he was aware that i purchased the ultimate wash? he said sorry they missed the interior and if i would allow them they would fix it. so i went back inside the waiting area. after another twenty minutes another gentleman came carrying a radio who i assumed was a supervisor. he said sorry again and the vehicle was ready. yeah not so much. as soon as i opened my back hatch to my sequoia it was clear they had not vacuumed, wiped anything down, the leather, glass or panels, dash and so on. at this point as a customer i starting to feel like i'm asking them a favor to perform their job or as if i was nitpicking. then i asked the supervisor what the managers name was and requested him to look my vehicle over. so terry comes out and opens the door to my car and says you're right this is unacceptable. he then personally takes over the job and i continue to wait as we approach three hours now. when i asked him if this is how long it usually takes he said no it's usually about 45 minutes. at no point did anyone try to make my experience right. i finally pulled out of the parking lot at 5:15pm. unreal. when i got home i noticed right side of the vehicle had bird poop all over it. the sad part about this is i had every intention of bringing in my other vehicle after this wash. needless to say, i was quite frustrated. \n",

      "i love my car, its a red pony.. i took it here for a wash. they left everything pretty shiny for what i can see. but i guess they forgot the inside, i wanted a deeper cleaning on the inside.. well it will be for next time. they paid attention to my tires and did the wash pretty quick, so it was a ok wash.\n",
      "i took my mini van here because i had just bought it and it needed cleaning. i paid $75 for a detail, plus $ 25 for a guy to fix a crack in my windshield. when we picked it up it was seriously no cleaner than before, and my windshield never got fixed. the manager told us to bring it back. so we took it back the next day and they re-washed it. the guy said sorry and that he would fix the windshield. when we picked it up it was still very dirty! my windshield never got fixed again! i finally took the van home and cleaned it myself. i took before and after pictures. a few days later, there was a horrible smell in the car. i opened the back and they had forgotten to put the car mats back! they were still wet and piled on top of each other.  i basically lost out on $100. and ended up spending a ton of time and money for nothing. these guys shouldn't be in business and no one should believe what the website says. i have heard the same thing from a lot of people that have gone there. it's a big rip off. go to danny's or anywhere else. just don't go here. oh and if you complain to the manager, he gets really mad and tells you to leave. very poorly run business.\n",

      "been bringing my toyota here for some time. came here today & asked for the $19.99 oil change.   the guy shoots back that i had to have a $65 synthetic oil change.  ummm, no i don't.   just cause i have boobs doesn't mean you get to upsell me.  some boob owners happen to be mechanics who only come here because they're not allowed to do oil changes at their apartment complex.  but, hey, my rent just went up $88, so guess i'll do it there anyway.  you can keep the $45 upsell.\n",

      "i went there today to get my car washed, used a groupon.  it's the cleanest i've ever seen it in years.  i watched for 45 minutes as the man (i wish i would've gotten his name) scrubbed and scrubbed the interior and used this awesome smelling strawberry spray.  it smells and looks amazing!!!  i've had \"just ok\" service from this place before at other locations, but this location is my absolute favorite now.  i'll definitely be back for more!  i've tried some of the air fresheners they sell inside.  the only ones that really work are the ones that come in the sealed cans... all the other gel pads and stuff don't work well at all, so don't waste your money on anything but the cans!\n",

      "the last 2 times i have been to this location i have requested that the back of my grand cherokee be cleaned out.  as in vacuum for dog hair and wipe down the interior of the windows.  for sitting arund for 30 plus minutes i would have expected that.  the car wash broke and the jeep was driven around just wet.  on the other hand the staff is friendly and i have not had any other issues.  i will probably still go back next time and hope for the back to be cleaned out properly.\n",
      "if i could give this place a -5 stars i certainly would!the management here are a bunch of liars and crooks!so much so that they have been made my special project!they had my dodge from 12p-5:30p.i left it with my last words being \"take all the time you need,just do it right\".well,if by \"doing it right\" means that i got my truck back still dirty and with broken peices of interior molding,then yeah they did okey dokey.after a bunch of back n forth about their responsabilities for my broken parts,daryle finally agreed to pay.he also offered a couple of free car washes.as if i would ever trust anything of mine in this outfits care again.so,after waiting for several weeks for a return call on when the repairs can be madei called and was informed that the parts would not be replaced.so now i have to go get a lawyer.thanks classic car spa.if you know whats good for you then you and yours would steer clear of this outfit.\n",
      "where oh where do i begin?i guess at the beginning.yes,my interaction with this business is turning into a saga.i was looking for a car wash business that would clean my headliner.a coworker told me that i could take my car here and it would be in \"good hands\".let me first start by saying that we have differant veiws on what good is.i pulled up to the spa and asked for \"ben\".(i type his name in lower case out of lack of respect.as he is a liar!)i asked if they cleaned headliners.he stated that they only service certain types of headliners.so i asked if he could check mine out to see if it qualified.he came out and inspected it and informed me that this headliner could indeed be cleaned.so without further hesitation i purchased the $100 detail package.i brought the truck in the following sunday at 12:01pm.dropped it off and told ben to take all the time he needs.i just want it done right.i get a call around 5:30 that its done.again,i dont care how long it takes.i dont want time crunch to be an excuse for poor performance.when i get there i can see plenty of armour all on the tires.so it looks good so far....from a distance.when i get inside i find broken peices of molding in the front and back!i wont even gripe about the puddles of armourall and the poor vacuuming job and the seats having water stains all over them.alot of which came from the shampooer splattering everywhere.and when i look up to see how well they did on the headliner.....it hadnt even been touched!and indeed it was dirtier than when i brought it in!there were black greasy specks sprinkled all over the headliner!so,i ask for management while this illegal alein is scrubbing at stuff.he informs me that i have to wait for jackie to show up the next day and talk to her.i do.and we schedule an appointment to have things looked at to see what can be resolved.then she calls the day before the appointment at closing time to reschedule for her a day off.i reluctantly agree.so my wife drops it off this moring with quotes from the dealership down at dodge.they tell my wife that they arent going to pay for the repairs to one panel and that they will need to discuss the back panel.their worker broke both panels!so i called and was told by darrel or doug or whatever the weasels name is that they arent paying for my repairs because \"i sent my wife to negotiate\"!i mean can you believe that?!as this man doesnt know how to behave honorably when talking to women?!if its a woman then he just runs over her rough shaud!i then informed him that he will be hearing from my lawyer.to which he said \"thats fine\" and i hung up.i then got on here to read reveiws and am glad i did.they wont only be losing my business but also the business of whom i work who regularly has a fleet of trucks they clean.and that doesnt seem to bother the manager at all.so i dont see this place staying in business if this is how they operate.they are not to be trusted with expensive vehicles.i wouldnt trust these people with my bycycle!there are plenty of other places to go.guess i will see if francis and sons are any better.anyways,i started a yelp account just so i could warn my fellow citizens of this place and its staff.stear clear if you like your car.\n",
      "close to home....but would never recommend.  went there today and watched my car dry itself for 25 minutes.  asked for a refund and was told by the attendant someone had dried it.  since i was sitting outside the whole time, i had a visual and told him that did not happen.  asked for a refund and he couldn't do it because i had used a cc....went inside, spoke to the manager who seemed to care less.  told her i thought it was awful that no one apologized, just gave excuses.  guess what, then she said i'm sorry.  terrible, terrible, terrible!\n",
      "thanks but no thanks! i got my car washed by these monkeys this morning. my car came out just as dirty as it went in except that i was 25.00 poorer than i was before! the service writer was more interested in getting an upsell on the ticket than what i was requesting to be cleaned. i had to spend five minutes with a rag wiping my card down after the guy told me it was ready. called in to the manager and he pretty much berated me for leaving but i had to get to work. i had wasted enough time trying to get a decent car wash from these guys. stay away...far away!\n",
      "i went here to get my car waxed. i was impressed with the prompt service. the service was typical with what you'd find at a car-wash place. they tended to me like a customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "however, i noticed the wax finish faded away quickly - about a month and a half. i'm not a genius on car waxes, but i recall wax holding its glossy and protective structure a few months. \n",
      "\n",
      "the price was nominal for the labor involved. $130, i recall. wasn't a great deal, but wasn't bad, either. \n",
      "\n",
      "the gas prices here are reasonable, but not a steal. they don't get a whole lot of gas customer traffic, so they pass the costs onto you. \n",
      "\n",
      "i'll probably be back again. nothing would abstain me from more car waxes except money with this place. :)\n",
      "let me first say that i went to this location after it had been specifically recommended as doing the best work in town.... can't even begin to say how disappointed i am.\n",
      "the young man who greeted me was very personable but, i found out later, unfortunately not knowledgable about the products or services accessible to the customers.  nonetheless, i payed $299.99 to have what they called the showroom treatment for my vehicle.   that means spotless, perfect in every way except obviously for preexisting paint, body and glass damages.  was told i would not believe how good my car would look and that the paint would feel as smooth as butter and that the build up that had accumulated over the last six months would be completely taken care of.  well, as one would say, my car looks goof from afar and that stops there.  \n",
      "- the paint has plenty of spots where it feels rough (not from old damaged paint but from what they defined as overspray).  a clay bar was supposed to be used.  i'm sure it was... just not everywhere it needed\n",
      "-they were supposed to use only top of the line professional grade products from meguiar's.  that's what i've used for years when i take care of my vehicles.  turns out there in the process of going to these products, so i got leftovers i was specifically told were being given to employees because they needed to get rid of them.\n",
      "- it was not buffed enough or evenly.  so, you can still see the products they used, finger and hand prints, smudges and swirls.\n",
      "- the windows and mirrors were not cleaned with streaks or swirls free products or clean .  many were  clearly visible just standing next to the car.  they were even worse when i drove into the sun to get home.\n",
      "- was told by greeter/salesperson who tells you what you need for the results you expect that mire giovanna rims would look spotless and that the gunk accumulated inside the rims would be taken care of.  no such luck.  was later told by supervisor, it could not be done because of safety reasons and injury prevention.  isn't it funny, i've done this clean up myself multiple times without any issue, damage physical or otherwise.  it only took time and patience.\n",
      "- the carpet cleaning left multiple spot in place.  i could forego that detail if it weren't for the cost and the statement of absolute quality like,,, \"you would believe how good your car will look.  just like the showroom.\"\n",
      "- the cargo area cover was not cleaned (not that it needed a lot of it to begin with).  some product was put on it so that it no longer is gripping the cargo it suppose to hold in place.  now, everything slides.  can only guess that they used some armor all type of products.\n",
      "- the entire process was supposed to take 2 hours.  it took almost 3.  that i could live with without any issues if the services delivered were up to what was sold and expected.\n",
      "- they used glossy products on my leather seats, doors in other interior parts.  really?!?  now, i have to clean up every bit of the interior of my car and hope the professional grade products i use will help the leather recover their elasticity and natural shine.\n",
      "\n",
      "last but not least, i heard the manager say: \"no tips?!?' in an unbelievable tome, when i got in my car to leave.  wow, i did not know one got tips based on poor performance.  i must be old fashioned and out of touch with the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "anyway,  i would not recommend them for any type of service.  if  $299.99 doesn't buy quality services then i can't imagine what less will...\n",
      "\n",
      "too bad.   i don't believe the individuals that work on my car were trying to do a bad job.  they were either not trained properly or are only doing what is asked of them which is definitely not enough too meet expectations of showroom quality.  a waste of time and money.\n",
      "great car wash. perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. great prices for excellent washes. only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around!!\n",
      "usually have a mediocre service experience  but today was unacceptable. asked for a particular wash was told that there was a special on the ultimate regularly $49.99. the special between an in house coupon $10 and a groupon discount would be $23.00. so went for it   well got the $10 but no such discount on groupon  the cashier, young guy was rude, arrogant and unhelpful. tossed him the $39 and will no longer use them. one of the employees tried to sell me a new windshield. the car is two months old and there was one tiny spot not worth talking about. then after i left i stopped at a store checked the hatch area and they didn't even clean / vacuum it.  spend between $30-$50 every two weeks. just lost a long time customer due to lies, inappropriate practices and lack of customer service. suggest you think twice on using classic car spa for your car needs on val vista in gilbert\n",
      "great car wash. perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. great prices for excellent washes. only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around!!!\n",
      "everyone please beware workers there steal from your car!!!!!\n",
      "my family would take all of our cars there to get washed but we will never go back again and i will tell everyone i can to not go there! my brother who is a u.s. marine gave my mom this beautiful necklace that he had engraved \" thank you for always supporting me mom\" that was stolen out of her car by one of the employees there!! if it was a random necklace i would say no big deal it can be replaced. but this was a priceless possession for her as my brother gave it to her after his boot camp graduation. i just want the person that works there that stole the necklace to know you stole a gift from a young man that is doing his part to help protect you and your freedom here in this country!!!\n"

      "we bring our two dogs (german shepherd and golden retriever) here all the time! usually on the weekends, we drive 45 min just to come here!\n",
      "we love it & so do our pups!\n",
      "great drink deals too!\n",
      "kiddie pools in the summer to keep your pup nice and cool!\n",
      "great atmosphere! but you must be a dog lover!\n",
      "never seen a fight or anything. sometimes you see one or two dogs trying to boss around others (there is a grey pitbull, that i think belongs to an employee that always does that) but nothing serious. \n",
      "wish there was one of these closer to gastonia/kings mountain!\n",
      "this is my favorite dog bar in the area! i miss living closer to it. the staff is super nice, and atmosphere is very laid back. my dog has a blast here. it's wonderful!\n",
      "great concept in a great location, that being said there is a ton of room for improvement, the fence isn't very tall and there are a lot of areas that there is a bench pushed up to the fence making it very easy for any dog to escape. \n",
      "they allow any dog in no questions asked. \n",
      "the entire place is in desperate need of a pressure wash and cleaning. \n",
      "they charge for a pint of beer but it's in a 12oz plastic cup, that's 1/3rd short of a pint. \n",
      "the bartenders, for the most part, are huge dog lovers (and good looking). \n",
      "no place will ever be perfect for everyone but with some attention to detail most of the negative reviews could be corrected with very little effort.\n",
      "just moved to noda this week and decided to try out the dog bar. parked in the parking lot for the dog bar and bar next door. the entire parking lot was a mess and people were parked behind cars not in spots. i parked next to a dozen other cars (of note, there were no marked \"spots\") all of which were facing the train tracks and not blocking anyone. there were no international towing signs. \n",
      "\n",
      "we went in and instantly smelled the dog urine stuck in the plastic astroturf (terrible idea for an area exposed to rain and dog urine). it was fine overall. \n",
      "\n",
      "when we left, my car was no longer there... we looked around in the parking lot and finally found an obscure sign with words that said you must be a dog bar or blind pig bar customer... which we were so we were still confused. there was still no international towing sign/symbol. we called the towing company and they said our car was \"too close to the track\" which is ironic because there was no sign saying anything about being towed or about the train tracks and the distance you needed to be. we went into the bar and told the bartender, she said \"oh no! yeah you can't see any spots they just come in and tow everyone, that sucks\". the cars that were illegally parked behind people and not in \"spots\" were not towed because i recognized the same cars backed up behind one another not in spots.) i am very frustrated with the dog bars response as well, if they often tow people for being too close to the tracks there should absolutely be a sign a few areas has a cement block but much of the area where people were parking did not. we were not closer than other cars to the track. again, there would need to be an international tow sign. \n",
      "\n",
      "needless to say, even though we relocated to noda we will be driving the extra 15 minutes to lucky dog bark & brew, where they have clearly marked parking spots and they don't tow. on top of that the facility is amazing and doesn't have old soiled astroturf. i highly recommend skipping this place for not only the parking inconvenience since they tow for unclear reason but also the place is a dump. \n",
      "\n",
      "also the tow fee was $200, ridiculous. i'll never return and will make sure to warn people about this place. not worth it.\n",
      "this is literally my favorite place on earth. i started brining rocky when i first got him a year ago. i try to bring my pup at least 2-3 time a week. the owner and staff are so so friendly and i love the small atmosphere. though they don't sell food, there are so many restaurants around you can grab a bite and bring it back. the parking isn't the best but honestly i don't mind it one bit. i trust this place more than the dog park.\n",
      "hilarious.  it's like you're drinking in a live action youtube video.\n",
      "the name says it all... it's a bar that you can bring your dogs to. husband and i had a pet friendly airbnb we were staying at so our 2 pups came with us on the trip. i had heard about the ppave, but didn't realize it was around the corner. a late night in, we came here to grab a drink with pups.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's like a dog park with alcohol served! the best of both worlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "the good.\n",
      "what i just said above. also, there's a decent beer selection to choose from. there's plenty of spots to chill at. it has an indoor/outdoor area and there's a covered patio with heaters. there's also a playground area and place to play some giant jenga.\n",
      "\n",
      "the bad.\n",
      "it's not necessarily bad, but there was the smell of dog pee out in the patio area. it's what you'd expect  being in zone full of dogs, but a human wouldn't mind for it to be cleaner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "it's definitely an experience and if you don't have a dog, but want one... this is the place to get your fix!\n",
      "ruf....ruf...........if i was a dog my tail would be wagging for dog bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "i do so love this place and for the 40 minutes or so my gf and i hung out here we just loved watching all the doggie drama running around.\n",
      "\n",
      "folks were nice...there was only an occassional humping....and no fights broke out...so all and all a good time was had by all.\n",
      "\n",
      "the inside was very cold....it always seems to be that way....and i'm not quite sure, but the bartender was nice and has a good selection of beers to choose from in the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "the best thing about this place.........and the worst, was we checked in via the yelp app on our phones, but only after we walked out the gate...only to find we got a \"free drink\" reward on our phones....so we'll be back!\n",
      "best place on earth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "owner and bartenders are amazing!... i always have the best time when i am there with my pup!\n",
      "puppies and hop drop and roll... i was in heaven. \n",
      "\n",
      "we saw this bar while we were walking around exploring the cool neighborhood of noda. we decided to check it out even though we didn't have our puppy with us. it was so fun. we had so much fun sitting in the big chairs on the outdoor patio, playing with the dogs that put a big smile on our face. of course, the bar smells like a place would with 20 dogs running around, but owners are really great about cleaning up after their furbabies. happy dogs, happy owners. can't wait to go back, this time with my dog. she'll love it.\n",
      "let the fur fly, y'all! i'm babysitting mans best friend and thought i would check out this place. totes recommending to all my charlotte bff's, like yesterday. \n",
      "\n",
      "the have pretty good parking, except during peak hours. if coming with fellow fur parents, car pool (and reduce that carbon footprint, too). once here, please go into the bar area so you can admire the wonderful selection of local craft beers on tap. then, head outside to monitor your fur child and socialize with the other fur parents. they have a few human games for you if like activities. \n",
      "\n",
      "you may see many fur parents taking selfies with your fur child. casual. i know. please feel free to partake in these selfie shenanigans with their dogs. now, i gotta go because there is this really adorable boxer puppy and we're gonna take a selfie! see you hereeeeee.\n",
      "this seemed like a really fun idea..\n",
      "\n",
      "i went to see my sister and her family and i took my dog..so we went to dog bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "well..i think if youre a regular, and know all the other people and dogs there that night, you will have fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "no one makes sure your dog has shots, theres pee puddles and poop is just sprayed away with a hose, possibly onto my feet..im not sure any employees were present, because other than the friendly bartender, no one is identified as staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "there were alot of large dogs that werent being watched by thier owners, who then thought it was funny that i was concerned about the well being of my small dog..maybe separate sections would be a good idea \n",
      "\n",
      "the place is really cute, and they have some fun merchandise as well..inside there are lots of cool pieces of dog artwork..beer prices were awesome\n",
      "the bartenders here are always friendly and have great drink suggestions. steph and adam are especially fantastic. it's a great place to let your dog run around and play while you hang out and drink. one of my favorite places in charlotte!\n",
      "sit. drink. stay. is the brilliant subtitle of this bar. this is a bar for people that love their dogs and enjoy a drink or two. people drink while their dogs play in a safe fenced in area. whatever you do please close one gate before you open the next gate when entering and leaving the bar. the bar is located right on the street and this is a safety measure as long as customers use it correctly. if you're lucky you'll get to meet some of the regulars, two of the sweetest great danes ever, skylar and pierce. totally one of my favorite bars ever.\n",
      "we love this place and have lucked out in that we live so close.   the main point of enjoyment for this place is being able to watch the dogs play and run around while you kick back a few drinks (which are much more reasonably priced than most of the bars in charlotte).\n",
      "hmmm. very different and i loved its good for dogs good for people! bar tenders are super friendly i love my dogs and they loved the dog bar. great way to meet new people if your new in the area.... if your not a  dog lover don't go its that simple.\n",
      "i just love this place! i always go to the dog bar like every weekend with my dogs n friends. adam and stephanie have always provided us the best services!! my dogs got so comfy by hanging out there as well. the best thing is that you can bring your own food to eat there and drink your favorite drinks with affordable price while your dogs are playing with others. who needs a doggie day care when you have this place to go? love this place!!\n",
      "my dog, thor, and i love the dog bar!\n",
      "\n",
      "before you venture out this way though, you should know what you're getting into... like other yelpers reviewed, you must be a dog person.  the dogs will come up to you, sniff you, kiss you, and sometimes jump on you.  the first time we went out here, everyone seemed very on top of their dogs' behavior.  if one dog was causing too much trouble, the owner took them home.  yesterday's experience was not so efficient.  there were a few dogs that blurred the lines between playing and fighting, and the owners did nothing except, \"sparky, no.\"  i have problems with this, but the trouble making dogs didn't mess with thor, so i just kept him occupied with other dogs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "they don't do food here, but you can bring food into the bar.  just prepare to have a lot of well behaved dogs showing off their tricks for a bite of your quesadilla. (get your food from cabo fish taco - nom nom nom).  i'll be back time and time again, but please - if your dog is not having fun, just take him home.  don't make the other dogs (and owners) deal with him.\n",
      "my boyfriend and i were in town from san diego and we're desperately missing our two pitty boys. we stumbled upon the dog bar after walking around in noda and we're so happy to see all the wagging tails! they serve beer in plastic cups and it's a great place to take your dog and have some drinks. all the dogs there got along great and we even made quick friends with the owner of a precious pit that was there. \n",
      "\n",
      "great place! wish they had one in san diego!\n",
      "i love this place.  have limited time, feel guilty for not spending more time with my dog.  guilt free drinking!\n",
      "this place is amazing! i couldn't love it more if i tried. the beer selection was great and the owner knew all 16 taps of craft beer by heart. he was extremely nice, welcoming and a good source of knowledge for things to do in the area. all of the dog owners were welcoming as well and the dogs were having just as good of a time as we were. i love that a place like this exists and here's another vote for him opening one up in new jersey!\n",
      "this is a great place if you get off on rude service. yeah, i love the dogs and their owners are pretty cool but the the gal that works the bar has the personality of wallpaper. the only thing this place has going is that they are the only game in town. if there were another, they'd clearly be the loser. last night i was swindled for $20 when i was told i had to register my dogs (i have two). oddly the place was crowded but i was the only one who had to pay the $20. the dog bar bites big time, even my dog had a poopy time.\n",
      "it's great to have a place like the dog bar in charlotte, even if you don't have a dog!  they offer drink  specials & always participate in the noda gallery crawls.   there is a front patio with bench seating for you & your dogs & an inside bar area with a wii.  for 1st timers take your dogs on a sunday when it's quiet & the drinks are cheap.  \n",
      "\n",
      "side note: just make sure your dogs do not have problems with xl dogs like great danes, there are always at least 3 or more there.\n",
      "this is a great idea, but run by really cranky people and antagonistic patrons.  like everyone is just pissed off and waiting to scold another dog owner.   i've gone a few times, and someone is always getting yelled at for some reason or another.  the dogs are happy, but the clients and wait staff are incredibly unfriendly.\n",
      "as a non-dog owner, this place is fun. the bartender is nice, and it's a good place to hang out and relax on a nice sunny day. they offer several local craft beers and have good beer specials. not being a beer drinker, i ordered a rum and diet, which was $5 using the house rum (still don't really know what that was), bacardi would have been $7. after drinking that i noticed another woman drinking a crispin in a can, (i would think a pint if i had to guess)... that was $4, so score one for that for those non-beer drinkers out there. \n",
      "\n",
      "like some other people who have commented, the conditions can become a bit unsanitary when you think about it too much, but that's why they don't serve food. the bartender is also in charge of cleaning up the poop. after i watched him fix my mixed drink i couldn't get past the fact that he also handled the cleaning up in other areas and stuck to the canned drinks. (really had nothing to do with him and what i observed, just my mind running around with all of the things that could happen.) \n",
      "\n",
      "i think this was a nice change of pace for a saturday afternoon and a lot of fun.\n",
      "really great place! i love going there and i really wished people with small dogs visited it more often. my dog, who is 30lbs, is usually hiding because there's so many big dogs. but he loves it!! he will play with all the dogs and i have never had a problem there. it was my second time visiting and this time there was an overprotective dog who was bullying every other dog and the owner just stood there. i wish there was at least 2 bartenders on busy nights because one isn't enough. i know it was busy but i waited over 30mins just to checkout because she was so busy with people coming up to the bar. it's such an amazing bar and i love being around all the people and dogs. its a must even if you don't own dogs!\n",
      "dropped in here last night during the noda/yelp kick-off event.  gotta say, i'm trying me best to not be a 'nancy' here but seriously this just isn't my kind of place to hang.  couple things stood out for me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "first and foremost, dogs off leashes.  most were well behaved but some were a bit too playfull and the only thing that kept running through my mind is what kind of liability insurance do the owners of this place carry?  if a dog bites someone mistakenly or not, i could easily sit a situation brew.  oh well, that's for others to worry about i suppose.\n",
      "\n",
      "secondly, maybe this was an isolated event, but lack of a/c in the bar area.  it was hot as hades in there even at 8:00pm at night.  dog heat i suppose?\n",
      "\n",
      "third and probably most bothersome for me is the pissing of the dogs happening all over the place.  yes, it's artificial turf but something about being enclosed in 300-400 sqft with 14 dogs and 8 of which have taken turns pissing on the floor, etc. really turns me off.  call me crazy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "bottom line, i love dogs, really, but there's a place for every(one) and thing.  i'm glad dog owners have a place to go if they want.  i just know that i'll probably avoid this place (at least until i get a dog :))\n",
      "i haven't had a dog in years (tear rolling down my cheek) but my gf does have a little dog, so i've been wanting a good reason to check out the dog bar in noda....i've traveled all over the world, but never seen a place like this...great idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "the place was well thought out to accommodate pooches of all sizes and the place is built so no manner of poop or pee pee would really do any damage or impact....kinda like \"kid proof\" but in  doggie type of manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you have ever owned a dog...well owned isn't quite the right word, but i find those folks just nice and laid back....and people are engaging and it's an easy place to strike up conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "beer and liquor is available and pricing is very reasonable, but i'd stay away from the well liquor as i saw 2 times while i was sitting at the outside bar a big dog behind the bar licking the tops of the well bottles then bolting off to hump some other doggy in the bar....so go with the canned beer just to be safe....unless you are into that kinda thing??? *grin*\n",
      "\n",
      "was there doggy drama...of course....were the personality and looks of the dogs as unique as owners...absolutely?  will i come here again....definitely?\n",
      "i really enjoyed dog bar, as did my precious angel, maeby. she's very social and played with the other dogs at the bar while we socialized with the humans. they have a lot of local  brews and i love that  they let you bring in takeout. \n",
      "\n",
      "some of the other dog parents were a bit over protective (my dog is part border collie and is very vocal when she plays) & i wasn't a fan of them trying to discipline my dog for having a good time (i know, i'm a ridiculous parent... it's a good thing i don't have kids). \n",
      "\n",
      "my only reason for not giving dog bar five stars is thatt a) i don't like unisex bathrooms and b)they let two chihuahuas up on the bar, which seemed a bit icky to have dogs prancing around where the beer was served. \n",
      "\n",
      "all in all, it's a great place in a fun location -we'll be back soon!\n",
      "this could be may new favorite hang out. i have no idea why it has taken me so long to get to the dog bar- i've owned my pup for over a year and i always feel guilty leaving him for a night out. now, i can bring my little guy out with me! you can bring your own food to the dog bar- we grabbed pizza slices from revolution around the corner. drinks were reasonably priced, there was a fire roaring in the fire pit and my friends and i brought our dogs- really what's not to love for a low key night out.\n"

      "the only downside that kinda made me nervous is when some of the dogs decide they aren't liking each other very much. a couple minor frays broke out and even though they were quelled very fast by the owners it left me a little cautious of being caught in the middle of one. \n",

      "also, another thing to note is that if you haven't been here in a while they have remodeled the place some and the bar is back against the far wall as you come in, it really opened up the space and looks much nicer and brighter than the old dark dankness it use to exude.\n",
      "i think this is such a great idea. a place where you can go to drink and bring your dogs and they can play with other dogs and you do not have to worry about them. \n",

      "this place isnt that sanitary. there are only two dog bars i can find in charlotte, this one and the lucky dog bark bar and brewery. i think there used to be others but they closed down. charlotte is a cool city to have dog bars, for that i definitely give it props. \n",
      "\n",
      "while this place has two bone shaped swimming pools, dog beds and games for adults to play, it isn't that clean. dogs would pee on dog beds, pee anywhere on the floor mixed in with already wet grounds, then poop right at the entrance. the humans also are not that fast at cleaning up after their dogs. they have buckets of water for the dogs, for those are clean, but they aren't dog bowls, and a chihuahua knocked a bucket down just like that. they have one play structure here, and throughout the bar except for one section is green carpet. the bar inside is also very dark and not airy. there is only one bathroom stall, very small and unisex. \n",

      "dog bar has been a favorite of mine for a bit but i have never been impressed enough to write a review until last night. after adopting in march i wanted to make sure i was able to get my pup out and about as much as possible. dog bar has been a perfect space for that. he is a 80lb ball of energy and loves other dogs so getting tired out at dog bar is a huge plus for me. they always have great local beers on tap, my dog has a great time and i have never had any issue. last night i unfortunately did but i wanted to make sure i included it in my review because it only raised my opinion of the dog bar. another dog was not taking too kindly to mine and kept coming up and being pretty aggressive towards him.i wasn't too worried because of my dog being very submissive and always backing down from those behaviors.  at one point while his owner was away there was a big greeting at the entrance of a dog coming in and in the scuffle my dogs ear got hurt. from my experience the mia owner is not normal, i have always experienced people having a good eye and read on their pups. however it is still a bar filled with dogs and things can happen. i don't think you can go to any dog bar and be surprised when dogs are acting like dogs. this being my first injury since adopting i had no idea what to do and was in a bit of shock. travis behind the bar was absolutely wonderful. he immediately gave me space to get cleaned up and calmed down. he brought out anything i might need and was so comforting and helpful. i hardly ever review places like i should but even after what could have been a horrible experience, the staff and fellow patrons were, as always, wonderful. this will not be our last adventure to the dog bar.\n",
      "the dog bar is a staple in our household. we love taking our grayson there. the atmosphere is relaxing, and the amenities are exactly what you need, and nothing you don't. the dogs have free reign to play and bark and... well.. be dogs, and us humans can drink to our hearts' content.\n",

      "you will definitely get a kick out of this place. lots of fun and friendly staff. they also have a giant jenga block set,\n",
      "i wanted to visit more than once to write my review because this is such a cool idea. unfortunately it misses the mark. the problem i think is in the choice of flooring. astroturf is not as hygienic as they make you believe and i've seen several owners simply spray their pets poop with a hose, this only spreads around the feces. everything below hip level has been peed on and there really is no hand sanitizer except for what you bring. the other problem is mixing alcohol with different types of owners. i see most all of the dogs, big and small, rambunctious and calm get along fine and do their thing but the people are a different story. i've seen near fights with over protective types and meh types. i think if this concept were really going to work, put a bar in a dog park not a dog park in a bar. needs more space for everyone.\n",
      "neighborhood friendly fun for you and your favorite dog pal.  great for sporting events, even go alone and meet new friends.  the owner has recently done a new renovation, which opened up the inside and made the place a lot more people friendly.  great drinks too and they don't mind if you order in or bring a picnic.\n",

      "first, as many people have already stated, there are no requirements that must be met for dogs allowed in the place. typically at daycares, etc dogs have to have all their shots and pass a temperament assessment. here....that does not exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "and secondly, the reason i have no desire whatsoever to return, is the staff. my credit card was charged for another persons tab...close to $100. rather than discuss that with me in an apologetic way, i was handed a handful of cash with no explanation. then my card had been run again for my purchase which was only one beer but it included a pitcher as well. i tried to get some explanations from the bartender and told her i did not order the pitcher. she nonchalantly told me that there were others with my name and got mixed up, but the pitcher was definitely asked to be put on my tab. so she would not take it off. \n",
      "\n",
      "so to sum things up, if you choose to visit this place....don't expect anything awesome and pay in cash so your card won't be charged by \"accident\" and for items that you don't order.\n",
      "as you would imagine this place really caters to dogs and does a great job at it.  if your dog likes to play with other dogs you have to bring them here.  it's like a playground for dogs with obstacles, slides, inside and out. the beer selection isn't bad at all, good enough to please the dog owners. for sure.  \n",

      "great place! super friendly bar tender - travis. the dogs are off leash so interaction between them is great. indoor/outdoor space with plenty of water for the dogs. prices for drinks are fair. its a bit smelly... but its a dog bar, to be expected.\n",
      "awesome, awesome place!!!! these guys are passionate about dogs too. it's cool their dogs are always with them! you can grab food from any local restaurant and kick it (aka drink) while your dog gets out all that energy! parking can be tricky as noda continues to grow. the staff is always pleasant and i can appreciate those amazing drink specials!!\n",
      "nothing better than enjoying a pitcher beer special while my dogs get to run around and be social! lots of delivery food options in the area with menus by the bar makes for an even better experience.... just don't call domino's - they mess up your order every time. the staff and customers are friendly which keeps us coming back\n",
      "you know how when you walk in a bar, you can love it or hate it, in seconds.  walking into the dog bar instantly loved it!  there are only a few bars that strangers talk to you, i love talking to everyone.  (now there's a shocker.)  \n",
      "\n",
      "if you are not a dog person, it might not be the place because the dogs do want to say hello.  it's kind of funny, you know they love going to play, dogs like dive bars too!  \n",

      "the patrons and staff are friendly and easy going, very diverse crowd, there is no cool factor, thus making it a very cool bar.   and the hot bartender is heavy handed too..  the dog bar makes me want to get a dog.\n",
      "great place and really nice staff! the only problem is that the place is more for big dogs. small breeds beware you will have to constantly watch your dog not to get stepped on by the bigger dogs. maybe one day they will have an area for small dogs and i can relax and not worry about my dog .\n",
      "i finally made it out this place after hearing so much about it, and the rumors are true - this place is awesome.  my dog absolutely loved it.  it has a large patio with a lot of seating so you can sit back and hang out while your dog runs around and plays with other dogs.  the inside area is smaller, but still plenty of room if you rather sit indoors and keep your dog inside as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "i was suprised by the beer selection, they seemed to have a pretty good amount on tap.  being that it was our first time, the owner was extremely nice and helpful and we filled out a form that took about a minute and paid a $10 fee (yearly).  they do not serve food but you can order food or bring it in and eat there.  i def will be doing that in the future since noda has so many great restraunts.\n",
      "\n",
      "i was a huge fan of this place, my boyfriend was, my friend was and our dogs were!! will def be back!\n",

      "my group of friends actually ended up here one night on a birthday bar crawl. a roll-the-dice event and someone randomly picked the dog bar. hands down the best stop of the night. the owners and staff were so friendly. the patrons all laid back. it was a really fun night... and none of us brought a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "so if you've got a friendly dog or just enjoy dogs in general, this is the place for you. warning to non-dog owners, one stop here may make you want to run to the humane society and adopt one immediately.\n",
      "if you have a playful pooch, why do you keep leaving him at home to go out with your friends, when you could be bringing him along? the recently renovated dog bar is the premier hangout for canines and their owners; and dog lovers without furry friends of their own can enjoy the scene and skip the poop-scooping. great drink deals, many tvs for watching your favorite teams, and super friendly service. my little man is known by name and freaks out with excitement every time when he realizes our destination is the dog bar.\n",
      "the dog bar is a great concept & it always appears to be a happening place.  unfortunately, my milo is still \"intact\" & won't ever be able to partake in the fun here.\n",

      "love this place. such a happy atmosphere and great outdoor area. there's a good selection of beers/drinks and they always have drink specials. plenty of seating area even when it gets super busy. best of all, the pups always have a great tired and leave tired!\n",
      "there appear to be two types of reviews for the dog bar in charlotte. there are the \"woohoo! finally a place for my dog and me!\" reviews and then there are the, \"yeah it might be a nice idea but dog poo and pee and free roaming dogs acting up... ewww...\" types of reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "i won't criticize the latter reviews, because i'm the kind of germophobe who won't put her purse on the kitchen table, and i take my shoes off when i'm indoors because i think, \"eww... think about where they've walked!\" \n",

      "we took our dog ella to the dog bar for the second time on st. patrick's day. the first time we took her was last year, when their patio was still gravel, she was still a puppy, and i was a nervous nellie about her bothering people or sitting her butt in a drinking bowl. i have loosened up in a year, and she's chilled out a bit. so on our second visit, we had a simply perfect time. we planned to spend an hour, but we spent about four instead, socializing with new friends, and enjoying the show as our dog made new friends of her own, both human and canine.\n",
      "\n",
      "the dog bar does not serve food, but on weekends and for special events, they often have food trucks in their parking lot, or you can get carryout from other restaurants in the area. we ate our food from the maki taco food truck on the patio tables at the dog bar. yes, dogs had recently lounged on the bar, but our food was protected by a styrofoam barrier, and we took care not to lick the tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "this year they put down new protective astroturf at the dog bar which is permeable, and designed for dog use. dogs peed and pooped on said astroturf, and it was kind of a \"one for all and all for one\" mentality as the nearest human would pick up the poop with a bag, and hoses were available to hose the rest down through the astroturf. jp took care to point out on the dog bar's facebook page that this astroturf is specially designed for dog use, meaning it's porous and is sanitized each night. i wasn't sitting on the astroturf, so i was no more bothered by walking on cleaned areas where dogs had peed or pooped than i would be at home in my  yard. (hint, this is why i take my shoes off when i get home anyway.)\n",
      "\n",
      "the most important reviewer of our experience at the dog bar can't type. her name is ella, and she had a blast. in fact, she's looking forward to us going again, likely this weekend. if you have a dog, or if you don't but you love dogs, the dog bar is a great place for them to hang out. i wish we had something closer to home in ballantyne, but for now we'll trek to noda to give our dog a great day, and to enjoy meeting new people. the dog bar is one of charlotte's most unique experiences, and i loved going and can't wait to go back!\n",
      "i have lived down the street from the dog bar for over 5 years but only ventured in this past fall when my sister got a pup.  it is really great for not just the dogs but the humans too!  they have great beer on tap, prices are very reasonable, bartenders always friendly and there are cute dogs running around having a blast!\n",
      "\n",
      "when we bring the puppy here she is legit tired for the next 3 days, its a great way for her to socialize and us too.  99% of the people i have encountered here are great except you do sometimes get people who openly admit to not liking dogs and then get mad when one of them jumps on them, uh hello its a dog bar don't come in if you can't deal with that!!\n",
      "\n",
      "my only tiny complaint is that there are times when the bathroom smells like the dogs and maybe some cats have been using it, but other than that it is surprisingly clean and people are good about cleaning up after the dogs.  overall though i really like it here and will continue to come down so the puppy can get her play time and i can get my drink time in!!\n",
      "it's a great place for your pup to have some off-leash fun with other dogs while you drink. but with that comes the inherent risk of a dog fight!\n",
      "love this place... it's a great spot to socialize your dog and relax with a beer as they run around and play. our dogs love going here and often play until they are completely exhausted. the bartender is a sweetheart and always greets us warmly. \n",

      "considering the amount of 4 and 5 star reviews i am reading here, i would have thought that this was a good place to go for a couple of beers....not so much. with that said, it has been a while since i just sidled up to a bar, sat down and drank a couple, so maybe things have changed drastically in regards to service, pricing and general  enjoyment of ones time.\n",

      "\n",
      "the place if fairly dive-y (me like-y) and there are dogs running all over the place. it's what i would expect. they have numerous beers on tap including local faves so i pulled up a stool and, though there was a big old spill in front of me, i figured the young lady tending bar would get that taken care of when i ordered. this is where i should have decided that a one and out would be my best bet. i ordered an omb copper which took a long time to get due to the changing of the keg halfway through the pour. she plopped the cup down and went to turn away, so i had to stop her to ask if she would be kind enough to wipe the bar down. (i had a notebook and my tablet at the ready to do some work) she gave a half-hearted swipe of the mess getting about half and then tossed a small stack of bev-naps on the bar near me, apparently so that i could do it myself. super!\n",
      "\n",
      "the lovingly made copper does wonders for one's soul and i happily ignored my disdain and worked on my menu. the bartender was a loud and boisterous soul (which i have no problem with as long as you are getting your work done). i finished my beer, during which time i found out that she was having decidedly too little sex with her not-a-real boyfriend,( just a fwb), watching her drop a case of beer on the floor and other fun stuff. she saw that my cup was empty and took care of the business of a fresh beer. that was pretty much the end of my personal service for the evening.  i finished the beer in about 20 minutes and placed my cup in front of me while i worked. she sat/stood about 4 feet away from me on the other side of the bar and told two guys all about her life, her website, all her hopes and dreams, about how cheap it is to have your mani-pedi done by asians, etc, while my cup sat there in plain view. i even made eye contact and yet at that time she was not ready to finish her role as talking person and it sat. then more people walked in (about 10) she walked by my empty cup and got to serving the crowd. at one point she served a couple of jagerbombs and knocked a fat shot of jager back herself while i sat there and watched. this operation took anther 10-15 minutes. at this point i had enough and just wanted to pay and roll. finally she deigns to give me the time of day and asks if i need another. no says i and i hand her a $20 to pay my 2 cups of beer. $9.50 later (for a beer made down the street) and i am on my way. \n",
      "\n",
      "in the last 20 minutes of my stay, she lost sales for her employer, stole liquor, broke the law by drinking behind the bar, and lost a good tip. not a good performance by a long shot.  i feel no need to ever go back and really rue the fact that i didn't take the time to get out faster and try another joint.\n",

      "-the bar doesn't \"allow\" jumping or humping, so feel free to get the dogs paws off the bar if you don't want it near you, or please break up any humping that may happen, even if its not your dog. also, its hard to always see your dog, so if another dog poops near you, it'd be swell if you could scooper it quick so others don't step in it. scooping poop is better than cleaning it off your dog later!\n",

      "update 4/5/12: the previously dirty gravel patio has been upgraded to a wonderful turf system that is santitized daily (and now i can actually wear normal clothes here! the previous patio made everything, and everyone, filthy). five stars!!\n",
      "so any place that allows my awesome, amazing, handsome dog gets 5 stars. however, my dog got very sick after going here so i have to subtract 2 stars. i do not fault the dog bar owners for the sickness, but if your dog is susceptible to getting sick easily i don't think it's a great place to take your dog. my vet yelled at me because you just can't predict how other people take care of their pets, so just be aware if your dog doesn't have a strong immune system. \n",
      "\n",
      "however, this place overall is just awesome. i love that you can take your pets and all the dogs seem to be super friendly. the beer is in plastic cups, but not too pricey. and they allow you to bring in pizza or any other food into the place since they don't serve any. \n",
      "\n",
      "if you are a dog lover, you can go here and see lots of cute pups!\n",
      "our dog loved his first visit there yesterday.  great for dogs of all ages and the staff was incredibly friendly.   will be coming back often!\n",
      "i love love love this place. the staff is super friendly and personable. i have always felt welcomed whenever i come. (by the people too) \n",
      "\n",
      "the beer is reasonably priced, and a great selection. noda brewery has a strong presence here. \n",
      "\n",
      "i recommend anybody with a well behaved dog to come, or even if you don't have a dog you'll have a great time.\n",
      "really cool concept, but seemed a bit unsanitary. i came there as a non-dog owner but one who loves dogs. there were a few dogs fighting that weren't really monitored which made me a bit nervous. i would go back and am giving this place 4 stars because the beer selection was good (lots of good local beers) and i love dogs, but you must be okay with the concept to like this place!\n",
      "so far so good. after reading the reviews i am a bit skeptical. there's a dog bar in lake norman where the staff picks up after the dogs so we don't have to worry about mess. from what i've read you just have to hope owners do it themselves which is ok  as long as they do. however, this place allows 18 years old and up where as the other only allowed 21 and up so that is awesome. i am excited to try this place out and hopefully write a good review later.\n",
      "if you have pets and want a beer then you must stop here. the pets even sit next to you at the bar. this place was really cool and the bartender knows how to make some very tasting drinks. i had some salty pretzel drink did not taste like alcohol at all. i wonder what the\n",
      "oh my gosh.  we came to watch a football game & actually watched the dogs.  at least 20 great dogs in here.  limited beer choices and no food (because dogs) but fun atmosphere especially for dog owners with laid back canine kids.  wish there was no smoking.  and clean bathroom.\n",
      "truly love this place. staff and patrons are so friendly not to mention all the great pups!\n",
      "so much fun if, and only if, you totally love dogs.  stinks.  but the run factor: 15 on a scale of 1/19. awesome\n",
      "i love dog bars. i love hanging out with my dog while having a beer, and i love not feeling guilty about leaving said dog at home while having a beer, but i do not like constantly having to untangle my dog from her leash while tied to a table. dog bar is the answer. the dogs run free, and have a great time so you can enjoy yourself as well. i also appreciate any bar i can show up in yoga pants to. their beer selection is great. not the cleanest place, and the smell isn't pleasant, but, dogs. even if you don't bring your dog the entertainment factor of dogs running around playing with each other or laying on the bar is pretty great.\n",
      "had a lot of fun visiting the dog bar. love the concept and can't believe places like this don't exist everywhere! very social place and i was happy to not see any issues break out between any of the dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "does not serve any food, but there are usually food trucks around, or you can pop into any of the other great restaurants in the area.\n",
      "super fun! looking for something to do while you drink? come here and pet some dogs! insider tip- bring your leftovers in a bag/box from where you just ate and the dogs will all be attracted to you and your wonderful smelling bag. now if only i had a similar trick with the ladies...\n",
      "are you one of those people that feels guilty every time they leave their pups at home?  well i am i always feel bad when i yet again leave the house and my little pups sit at the window and wonder why they can't come with.  well problem solved (as far as grabbing  beers and cocktails)  the dog bar in noda is the perfect place to relax outside with your pups grab a few drinks, hang out with friends, and hopefully meet some new human and canine friends.  at least you know when you come to the dog bar you already have something in common with the people that hang out there!\n",
      "\n",
      "i love the dog bar now i must admit my dogs can be a little neurotic so i needed to check the place out by myself before i actually brought them with me.  its great that the dogs are free to roam around the bar, you may have a dog next to your feet, standing on the table beside you, begging for a sip of your tasty drink but they are all having a great time.  looking forward to some nice weather and outings at the dog bar this spring and summer!\n",
      "we decided to give the dog bar a try last saturday night.  our dog ross is 4, so we figured he was old enough to drink legally now.  we had a fun time watching ross socialize with other dogs, as he never gets a chance to.  yes, he tries to sniff the occasional butt while we're walking through the park, but it gets crazy there when you're trying to get some exercise.  plus, at the dog bar, at least we can have a drink in our hands while ross does his thing.  all of the dogs were so well-behaved, too.  we were amazed.  maybe it's the beer they have in the dog bowls?  kidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a great concept and i love the option of taking your dog with you on an evening out when you have such little free time as it is.   other than the adorable dogs, i can't  much about the atmosphere of the dog bar.  they could use a little more decor and sprucing up to make it even more dogcentric than the one fire hydrant.  plus, the service was a bit lacking, the beer warm, and they were only accepting cash that night (who carries cash anymore?).  so it really is about the dogs and the company you bring with you.\n",
      "i like this small dog bar. it's in a very artsy part of town. it's all fenced in and dogs can even sit on the bar. i saw that and had to go! i picked this as destination for my birthday weekend. the locals were very friendly, service was good, and drinks were flowing. they have a kissing booth and pool for the dogs. i got the best photos and had so much fun with my husband and pup for my birthday.\n",
      "i went here twice already. the most recent visit was because of a doggie's 2nd birthday party., awesome place for it. if you have the love for dogs. this bar is like you died and went to heaven.. dogs galore. and their owners are understanding and are aware of their dogs and their dogs surrounding.. and to top it off, your dog can run freely while you socialize and have a few drinks. i mean i can't complain. just perfext!\n",
      "dog + beer = cool idea.  but beer in plastic cups?!  yuck.  not a place i'd want to spend more than an hour, but a good place to come with your friends who have doggies with a need to socialize.\n"
